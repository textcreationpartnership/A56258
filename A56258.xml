            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Tranſlator having obſerv'd, in moſt of the Diſputes wherewith the preſent Age is diſquieted, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Appeals made, and that very properly, from <hi>Laws and Ordinances of a meaner Rank</hi> to the everlaſting <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> gave himſelf the Pains, to turn over ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Writers on that Subject. He chanc'd, he thinks with great Reaſon, to entertain an Opinion that this Author was the cleareſt, the fulleſt and the moſt unprejudic'd of any he met with: and hereupon that he might the better poſſeſs himſelf of his Reaſonings, he attempted to render the Work into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue, after he had firſt endeavoured to ſet ſeveral better hands upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
<pb facs="tcp:59922:4"/>
who all for one Reaſon or other declin'd the Toil. He thought when 'twas done, it might be as acceptable to one or other to read it, as it had been to himſelf to tranſlate it. If he have not done right to the Author, as he hopes he has not miſs'd in any material Point, he is very willing to be corrected.</p>
            <p>The Work, 'tis true, is as it were, an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Author's large Volume; but having been extracted and publiſht by <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> the Reader cannot be under any doubt, but that he has the Quinteſſence of what is there deliver'd. What is par'd off, being moſtly Caſes in the Civil Law, Refutations of other Authors, and ſome Notions too fine and unneceſſary for a Manual.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Author</hi> 'tis enough to ſay, that he has ſurely had as great regard paid him from Perſonages of the higheſt degree, as perhaps ever was given to the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of men; being invited from his Native Country, firſt by the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> to be Profeſſor of the Law of Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:59922:4"/>
in the Univerſity of <hi>Heidelberg;</hi> then by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to honour his new-raiſed Academy by accepting the ſame Charge therein, and afterwards being admitted of the Council and made Hiſtoriographer both to the ſame King, and to his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Brandenburgh:</hi> Where, except he be very lately dead, he lives at this time in the greateſt reſpect of all men of Senſe and Understanding.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAD not the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> which has ſo generally obtain'd among Learned men almoſt procur'd to itſelf the force of a <hi>Law,</hi> it might ſeem altogether ſuperfluous to premiſe a Word concerning the Reaſon of the preſent Undertaking; the Thing itſelf plainly declaring my whole Deſign to be the giving as ſhort and yet, if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not, as <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>perſpicuous</hi> a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi> of the moſt material Articles of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> as was poſſible; and this, leſt if thoſe who betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this ſort of Study ſhould enter the vaſt Fields of Knowledge without
<pb facs="tcp:59922:5"/>
having fully imbib'd the Rudiments thereof, ſhould at firſt ſight be terrified and confounded by the Copiouſneſs and Difficulty of the Matters occurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And at the ſame time it ſeems plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very expedient Work for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick that the minds of Youth eſpecially ſhould be early imbued with that <hi>Moral Learning,</hi> for which they will have ſuch manifeſt occaſion and ſo frequent uſe through the whole Courſe of the Lives. And although I have always look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a Work deſerving no great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to Epitomize the larger Writings of others, and more eſpecially ones own; yet having thus done out of Submiſſion to the commanding Authority of my Superiors, I hope no honeſt man will blame me for having endeavour'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the improvement of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of young Men more particularly; to whom ſo great regard is to be had, that whatſoever Work is undertaken for
<pb facs="tcp:59922:6"/>
their ſakes, though it may not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of great Acuteneſs or ſplendid Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, yet it is not to be accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any mans Pains. Beſide that no Man in his Wits will deny that theſe Principles thus laid down are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the underſtanding of all Law in general, than any Elements of the Law Civil can be.</p>
            <p>And this might have ſuffic'd for the preſent, but I am minded by ſome, that it would not be improper to lay down ſome few Particulars, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to a right Underſtanding of the Conſtitution of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and for the better aſcertaining its juſt Bounds and Limits. And this I have been the more ready to do, that I might on this occaſion obviate the Pretences of ſome over-nice Gentlemen who are apt to paſs their ſqueamiſh Cenſures on this ſort of Learning, which in many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is wholly ſeparate from their Province.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59922:6"/>
Now 'tis very manifeſt, that Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Knowledge of their Duty, and what is fit to be done, or to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Life, as it were from three Springs or Fountain-Heads; to wit, from the Light of Nature, from the Laws and Conſtitutions of Countries, and from the ſpecial Revelation of Almighty God. From the firſt of theſe proceed all thoſe moſt common and ordinary Duties of a man, more particularly thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute him a <hi>ſociable Creature</hi> with the reſt of Mankind; from the ſecond are derived all the Duties of a Man, as he is a <hi>Member</hi> of any particular <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> from the third reſult all the Duties of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Man. And from hence proceed three diſtinct Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the firſt of which is of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> common to all Nations; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is of the Civil or Municipal Law peculiar to each Country, which is or may be as manifold and various as there
<pb facs="tcp:59922:7"/>
are different States and Governments in the World: the third is Moral Divinity, as it is contra-diſtinct to that Part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which explains the Articles of our Faith.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe Sciences have a peculiar way of proving their Maxims, according to their own Principles. The <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> aſſerts that this or that thing ought to be done, becauſe from <hi>right Reaſon</hi> it is concluded that the ſame is neceſſary for the Preſervation of Society amongſt men.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Civil Laws</hi> and Conſtitutions, the ſupreme Reaſon is the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obligation of <hi>Moral Divinity</hi> lies wholly in this, becauſe God in the ſacred <hi>Scripture</hi> has ſo commanded.</p>
            <p>Now as the Civil Law preſuppoſes the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> as the more general Science; ſo if there be any thing contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> wherein the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is altogether ſilent, we muſt not
<pb facs="tcp:59922:7"/>
therefore conclude that the one is any ways repugnant to the other. In like manner if in <hi>Moral Divinity</hi> ſome things are delivered as from Divine Revelation, which by our Reaſon we are not able to comprehend, and which upon that ſcore are above the reach of the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> it would be very abſurd from hence to ſet the one againſt the other, or to imagine that there is any real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency between theſe Sciences. On the other hand, in the Doctrin of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> if any things are to be preſuppoſed, becauſe ſo much may be inferr'd from Reaſon, they are not to be put in Oppoſition to thoſe things which the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> on that Subject delivers with greater Clearneſs, but they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken in an abſtracted Senſe. Thus, for Example, from the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> abſtracted from the Account we receive thereof in holy Writ, there may be formed an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:59922:8"/>
and State of the firſt Man as he came into the World, only ſo far as is within the Comprehenſion of <hi>Humane Reaſon.</hi> Now to ſet thoſe things in oppoſition to what is deliver'd in Sacred Writ concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame State, would be the greateſt Folly and Madneſs in the World.</p>
            <p>But as it is an eaſie matter to reconcile the <hi>Civil Law</hi> with the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> ſo it ſeems a little more difficult to ſet certain Bounds between the ſame <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Moral Divinity,</hi> and to define in what Particulars chiefly they differ one from the other.</p>
            <p>And upon this Subject I ſhall deliver my Opinion briefly, not with any Papal Authority, as if I was exempted from all Error by any Peculiar Right or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, neither as one who pretends to any Enthuſiaſtick Revelation; but only as being deſirous to diſcharge that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince which I have undertaken, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of my Ability. And, as
<pb facs="tcp:59922:8"/>
I am willing to hear all Candid and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Perſons, who can inform me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and am very ready to retract what I have ſaid amiſs; ſo I do not value thoſe Pragmatical and Poſitive Cenſurers and Buſie-bodies, who boldly concern themſelves with things which no ways belong to them; of theſe Perſons we have a very Ingenious Character given by <hi>Phaedrus: They run about,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as mightily concern'd, they are very buſie even when they have nothing to do, they puff and blow without any occaſion, they are uneaſie to themſelves, and troubleſome to every body elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Chief Diſtinction, whereby theſe Sciences are ſeparated from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, proceeds from the different Source or Spring, whence each derives its <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> and of which I have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd. From whence it follows; if there be ſome things, which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd in Holy Writ either to do or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
<pb facs="tcp:59922:9"/>
the Neceſſity whereof cannot be diſcover'd by Reaſon alone, they are to be look'd upon as out of the Cognizance of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and properly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to <hi>Moral Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover in <hi>Divinity</hi> the Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as it has the Divine Promiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to it, and with relation to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and Man; from which conſideration the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> abſtracts, becauſe the other derives it ſelf from a particular <hi>Revelation</hi> of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and which <hi>Reaſon</hi> alone could not have found out. Beſides too there is this Great Difference, in that the main End and Deſign of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is included within the Compaſs of this Life only, and ſo thereby a Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd how he is to live in Society with the reſt of Mankind: But <hi>Moral Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> inſtructs a Man how to live as a Chriſtian, who is not oblig'd to live honeſty and vertuouſly in this World;
<pb facs="tcp:59922:9"/>
but is beſides in earneſt expectation of the Reward of his Piety after this Life, and therefore he has his Converſation in Heaven, but is here only as a Stranger and a Pilgrim. For altho the Mind of Man does with very great ardency pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after Immortality, and is extremely averſe to its own Deſtruction, and thence it was that moſt of the Heathens had a ſtrong perſwaſion of the ſeparate State of the Soul from the Body, and that then Good Men ſhould be rewarded, and Evil Men puniſh'd: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch a ſtrong Aſſurance of the certainty hereof, upon which the Mind of Man can firmly and entirely depend, is to be deriv'd only from the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Hence it is that the Dictates of the Law of Nature are adapted only to <hi>Humane Judicature,</hi> which does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf beyond this Life; and it would be abſurd in many reſpects to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to the Divine <hi>Forum,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:59922:10"/>
concerns itſelf only about Theology. From whence this alſo follows, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Humane Judicature</hi> regards only the external Actions of Man, but can no ways reach the Inward Thoughts of the Mind, which do not diſcover themſelves by any outward Sign or Effect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is for the moſt part exerciſed in forming the outward Actions of Men. But <hi>Moral Divinity</hi> does not content itſelf in regulating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Exterior Actions;</hi> but is more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly intent in forming the <hi>Mind,</hi> and its internal Motions agreeable to the good Pleaſure of the Divine Being; diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe very Actions, which outwardly look well enough, but proceed from an impure and corrupted Mind. And this ſeems to be the Reaſon why the ſacred Scripture doth not ſo frequently treat of thoſe Actions, that are enjoyned under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Penalties by Humane Laws, as it doth of thoſe, which, as <hi>Seneca</hi> expreſſes it,
<pb facs="tcp:59922:10"/>
are out of the reach of any ſuch Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. And this will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to thoſe, who ſhall carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Precepts and Virtues that are therein inculcated; although even thoſe Chriſtian Virtues do very much diſpoſe the Minds of Men, towards the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mutual Society; ſo likewiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Divinity does mightily promote the Practice of all the main Duties, that are enjoyned us in our Civil Deportment: So that if you ſhould obſerve any one behave himſelf like a reſtleſs and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Member in the Common-wealth, you may fairly conclude that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion has made but a very ſlight impreſſion on that Perſon, and that it has taken no Root in his Heart. And from theſe Particulars I ſuppoſe may be eaſily diſcovered not only the certain Bounds and Limits which diſtinguiſh the Law of Nature, as we have defin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d it, from Moral Divinity; but it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:59922:11"/>
be concluded that the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no ways repugnant to the Maxims of ſound Divinity; but is only to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from ſome particular Doctrines thereof, which cannot be fathom'd by the help of Reaſon alone. From whence alſo it neceſſarily follows, that in the Science of the Law of Nature, a Man ſhould be now conſidered, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved in his very Nature, and upon that Account, as a Creature ſubject to many vile Inclinations: For although none can be ſo ſtupid, as not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in himſelf many Evil and Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affections, nevertheleſs, unleſs we were inform'd ſo much by Sacred Writ, it would not appear that this Rebellion of the Will, was occaſioned by the firſt Mans Tranſgreſſion; and conſequently ſince the Law of Nature does not reach thoſe Things which are above Reaſon, it would be very prepoſterous to derive it from the State of Man, as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
<pb facs="tcp:59922:11"/>
before the Fall; eſpecially ſince even the greateſt part of the Precepts of the Decalogue, as they are delivered in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Terms, do manifeſtly preſuppoſe the depraved State of Man. Thus for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the Firſt and Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſeems to be ſuppoſed that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was naturally prone to the belief of Polytheiſm and Idolatry. For if you ſhould conſider Man as in his Primitive State, wherein he had a clear and diſtinct Knowledg of the Deity, as it were by a peculiar Revelation; I do not ſee how it could ever enter into the Thoughts of ſuch a one, to frame any thing to himſelf, to which he could pay Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence inſtead of or together with the true God, or to believe any Divinity to reſide in that which his own Hands had form'd; therefore there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of laying an Injunction upon him in Negative Terms, that he ſhould not worſhip other Gods; but this Plain,
<pb facs="tcp:59922:12"/>
Affirmative Precept would have been ſufficient; Thou ſhalt love, honor and adore God, whom you know to have created both yourſelf and the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe. And the ſame may be ſaid of the Third Commandment, for why ſhould it be forbidden in a Negative Precept, to blaſpheme God, to ſuch a one who had at the ſame time a clear and perfect Underſtanding of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Majeſty, and who was actuated by no inordinate Affections, and whoſe Mind did chearfully acquieſce in that Condition, wherein he was placed by Almighty God? How could ſuch a one be Guilty of ſo great Madneſs? But he needed only to have been admoniſhed by this Affirmative Precept, That he ſhould glorifie the Name of God. But it ſeems otherwiſe of the Fourth and Fifth Commandments, which as they are Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Precepts, neither do they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily preſuppoſe the depraved State of
<pb facs="tcp:59922:12"/>
Man, they may be admitted, Mankind being conſidered as under either Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the thing is very manifeſt in relation to the other Commandments, which concern our Neighbour; for it would ſuffice plainly to have enjoyned Man, conſidered as he was at firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, that he ſhould love his Neighbour, whereto he was beforehand enclined by his own Nature. But how could the ſame Perſon be commanded, that he ſhould not kill, when Death had not as yet faln on Mankind, which entred into the World upon the account of Sin? But now there is very great need of ſuch a Negative Command, when inſtead of loving one another, there are ſtir'd up ſo great Feuds and Animoſities among Men, that even a great Part of them is owing purely to Envy, or an inordinate Deſire of invading what belongs to another; ſo that they make no ſcruple not only of deſtroying
<pb facs="tcp:59922:13"/>
thoſe that are innocent, but even their Friends, and ſuch as have done them ſignal Favors, and all this forſooth they are not aſhamed to diſguiſe under the ſpecious pretence of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In like manner what need was there expreſly to forbid Adultery among thoſe married Perſons, whoſe mutual Love was ſo ardent and ſincere? Or what occaſion was there to forbid Theft when as yet Covetouſneſs and Poverty were not known, nor did any Man think that properly his own, which might be uſeful or profitable to another? Or to what purpoſe was it to forbid the bearing Falſe Witneſs, when as yet there were not any to be found, who ſought after Honor and Reputation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by Slandering and aſperſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with falſe and groundleſs Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? So that not unfitly you may here apply the Saying of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Vetuſtiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Mortalium, nulla adhuc prava li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidine,
<pb facs="tcp:59922:13"/>
ſine probro, ſcelere, eoque ſine poena aut coercitionibus agebant; &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi nihil contra morem cuperent, nihil per metum vetabantur. <hi>Whilſt no corrupt Deſires deprav'd Mankind, the firſt Men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without Sin and Wickedneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from Reſtraint and Puniſhment, and whereas they coveted nothing but what was their due, they were barr'd from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe things being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood may clear the way for removing this Doubt; whether the Law was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or the ſame in the Primitive State of Nature before the Fall? Where it may be briefly anſwer'd, that the moſt material Heads of the Law were the ſame in each State; but that many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Precepts did vary according to the diverſity of the Condition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; or rather that the ſame Summary of the Law was explain'd by divers, but not contrary, Precepts; according to the
<pb facs="tcp:59922:14"/>
different State of Man, by whom that Law was to be obſerv'd. Our Saviour reduc'd the Subſtance of the Law to two Heads: <hi>Love God, and Love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> To theſe the whole <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> may be referr'd, as well in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, as in the deprav'd State of Man; (unleſs that in the Primitive State there ſeems not any or a very ſmall difference between the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Moral Divinity.)</hi> For that Mutual Society, which we laid down as a Foundation to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> may very well be reſolv'd into the Love of our Neighbour. But when we deſcend to particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, there is indeed a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both in relation to the Commands and Prohibitions. And as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Commands, there are many which have place in this State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which ſeem not to have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the Primitive State: And that partly becauſe they preſuppoſe ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:59922:14"/>
Condition, as, 'tis not certain, could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to that moſt happy State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; partly becauſe there can be no Notion of them, without admitting <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which were unknown there: As for Inſtance, we are now enjoyn'd by the Precepts of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> not to deceive one another in buying or ſelling, not to make uſe of falſe Weights or Meaſures, to repay Money that is lent, at the appointed time. But it is not yet evident, whether if Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had continued without ſin, there would have been driven any Trade and Commerce, as there is now in the World, or whether there would then have been any Occaſion for the Uſe of Mony. In like manner if ſuch kind of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as are now adays, were not to be found in the State of Innocence, there would be then likewiſe no Occaſion for thoſe Laws, which are preſuppoſed as requiſite for the well ordering and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb facs="tcp:59922:15"/>
of ſuch Societies. We are alſo now commanded by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> to ſuccour thoſe that are in want, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe that are oppreſſed, to take care of Widows and Orphans. But it would be to no purpoſe to have incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated theſe Precepts to thoſe who were no ways ſubject to Miſery, Poverty or Death. The <hi>Law of Nature</hi> now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to forgive Injuries, and to uſe our utmoſt Endeavours towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Peace amongſt Mankind; which would be unneceſſary among thoſe who never offended againſt the Laws of Mutual Society. And this too is very evident in the Prohibitory Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which relate to the Natural not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law. For altho every Command does virtually contain in itſelf a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the oppoſite Vice; (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he that is commanded to love his Neighbour, is at the ſame time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to do ſuch Actions, as may any
<pb facs="tcp:59922:15"/>
ways thwart or contradict this Duty of Love:) yet it ſeems ſuperfluous that theſe things ſhould be ordain'd by expreſs Commands, where there are no diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inclinations to excite Men to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch Wrongs. For the Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, this may be taken notice of, that <hi>Solon</hi> would by no Publick Law enact any Puniſhment for <hi>Parricides,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought that no Child could be guilty of ſo horrid an Impiety. The like whereof we may find in what is reported by <hi>Francis Lopez,</hi> in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Weſt-Indies, Chap.</hi> 207. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the People of <hi>Nicaragua;</hi> he tells us, that they had not appointed any Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for thoſe who ſhould kill their Prince; becauſe, ſay they, there can be no Subject, who would contrive or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate ſo baſe an Action. I am afraid it may ſavour too much of Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enlarge any farther in the Proof of what is in itſelf ſo clear and evident.
<pb facs="tcp:59922:16"/>
Yet I ſhall add this one Example fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the meaneſt Capacity. Suppoſe there are two Children, but of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diſpoſitions, committed to the Care of a certain Perſon; One where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is Modeſt and Baſhful, taking great Delight in his Studies; the other proves Unruly, Surly, giving himſelf over more to looſe Pleaſures, than to Learning. Now the Duty of both of theſe is the ſame, to follow their Studies; but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Precepts proper to each, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; for it is ſufficient to adviſe the former to what kind of Studies he muſt apply himſelf, at what time and after what manner they are to be followed: But as for the other, he muſt be enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under ſevere Penalties, not to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abroad, not to Game, not to ſell his Books, not to get others to make his Exerciſes, not to play the good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, not to run after Harlots. Now if any one ſhould undertake in a ſet Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb facs="tcp:59922:16"/>
to declaim againſt theſe things to him of the contrary Temper, the Child may very well enjoyn him Silence, and bid him inculcate them to any Body elſe, rather than to him, who takes no Delight or Pleaſure in ſuch Practices. From whence I look upon it as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Law of Nature would have a quite different Face, if we were to conſider Man, as he was in his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive State of Innocence. And now ſince the Bounds and Limits of this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from Moral Divinity, are ſo clearly ſet down, it ought at leaſt to have the ſame Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges with other Sciences, as the Civil Law, Phyſick, Natural Philoſophy and the Mathematicks; wherein if any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Perſon preſum'd to meddle, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to himſelf the Quality of a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, without any Authority, he may fairly have that objected to him, which was formerly done by <hi>Apelles</hi> to <hi>Megaby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> who undertook to talk at random
<pb facs="tcp:59922:17"/>
about the Art of Painting; Pray, ſaid he, be ſilent, leſt the Boys laugh at you, who pretend to talk of Matters you do not underſtand.</p>
            <p>Now upon the whole, I am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubmit my ſelf to the Judgment of Diſcreet and Intelligent Perſons; but as for Ignorant, and Spiteful Detracters, 'tis better to leave them to themſelves, to be puniſhed by their own Folly and Malice; ſince, according to the Ancient Proverb, <hi>The Ethiopian cannot change his Skin.</hi>

And by this the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind are govern'd, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good fortune of few to be able to enquire into and to know the Cauſes of things.</p>
                  <p>AND yet it chances often, to ſome <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Conſcience doubting.</hi>
                     </note> Men eſpecially in ſingular Caſes, that Arguments may be brought on <hi>both</hi> ſides, and they not be Maſters of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Judgment</hi> to <hi>diſcern</hi> clearly which are the ſtrongeſt and moſt weighty. And this is call'd a <hi>doubting Conſcience.</hi> In
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59922:21"/>
which Caſe this is the Rule; as long as the Underſtanding is unſatisfied and in doubt, whether the thing to be done be good or evil, the doing of it is to be deferred. For to ſet about doing it before the Doubt is anſwered, implies a ſinful deſign or at leaſt a neglect of the Law.</p>
                  <p>MEN alſo oftentimes have <hi>wrong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions</hi>

                     </note> of the matter, and take that to be true which is falſe; and then they are ſaid to be in an <hi>Error;</hi> and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vincible Error,</hi> when a man by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying due Attention and Diligence might have prevented his falling thereinto; and it's ſaid to be <hi>Invincible Error,</hi> when the perſon with the utmoſt Diligence and Care that is conſiſtent with the common Rules of Life, could not have avoided it. But this ſort of Error, at leaſt among thoſe who give their Minds to improve the Light of Reaſon and to lead their Lives regularly, happens not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of living, but only in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar matters. For the Precepts of the Law of Nature are plain; and that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator who makes poſitive Laws, both does and ought to take all poſſible Care, that they may be underſtood by thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59922:22"/>
who are to give obedience to them. So that this ſort of <hi>Error</hi> proceeds only from a ſupine <hi>Negligence.</hi> But in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Affairs 'tis eaſie for ſome Error to be admitted, againſt the will and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of the perſon, concerning the Object and other Circumſtances of the Action.</p>
                  <p>BUT where Knowledge ſimply is <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
                     </note> wanting it is called <hi>Ignorance.</hi> Which is two ways to be conſider'd; firſt, as it contributes ſomewhat to the Action; and next, as it was in the perſon either againſt his will or not without his own fault. In the firſt reſpect Ignorance uſes to be divided into <hi>efficacious</hi> and <hi>concomitant.</hi> That, is ſuch as if it had not been, the preſent Action had not been undertaken: This, tho it had not been, it l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d not hindred the Undertaking. In the latter reſpect the Ignorance is either <hi>Voluntary</hi> or <hi>Involuntary.</hi> The firſt is, when it was <hi>choſen</hi> by the perſon, he rejecting the <hi>means</hi> of knowing the Truth, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to come upon him by not uſing ſuch <hi>diligence</hi> as was neceſſary. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, when a Man is ignorant of that, which he <hi>could</hi> not nor was <hi>obliged</hi> to know: And this again is twofold; for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59922:22"/>
either a man may indeed not be able to help his Ignorance for the <hi>preſent,</hi> and yet may be to blame becauſe he <hi>continues</hi> in ſuch a ſtate; or elſe he may not only be for the <hi>preſent</hi> unable to conquer his Ignorance, but may alſo be <hi>blameleſs</hi> that he is fallen into ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>THE other Faculty which does pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly <note place="margin">IX. <hi>The Will.</hi>
                     </note> diſtinguiſh Men from Brutes is called the <hi>Will,</hi> by which as with an internal Impulſe Man <hi>moves himſelf</hi> to Action, and <hi>chuſes</hi> that which beſt pleaſes him; and rejects that which ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for him. Man therefore has thus much from his <hi>Will;</hi> firſt, that he has a power to act <hi>willingly,</hi> that is, he is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by any intrinſick <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to do this or that, but is Himſelf the Author of his own Actions; next, that he has a power to act <hi>freely,</hi> that is, upon the Propoſal of one Object, he may <hi>act</hi> or not <hi>act,</hi> and either entertain or reject: or if divers Objects are propoſed, he may <hi>chuſe</hi> one and <hi>refuſe</hi> the reſt. Now whereas among human Actions ſome are undertaken for their <hi>own</hi> ſakes, others becauſe they ſubſerve to the attaining of ſomewhat <hi>farther;</hi> that is, ſome are as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59922:23"/>
the <hi>End,</hi> and others as <hi>Means;</hi> as for the <hi>End,</hi> the Will is thus far concern'd, That being once known, this firſt <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> it, and then moves vigorouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>atchieving</hi> thereof, as it were driving at it with more or leſs earneſtneſs; and this <hi>End</hi> once <hi>obtain'd</hi> it ſits down quietly and <hi>enjoys</hi> its acquiſt with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For the Means, they are firſt to be approv'd, then ſuch as are moſt fit for the purpoſe are <hi>choſen,</hi> and at laſt are <hi>applied</hi> to uſe.</p>
                  <p>BUT as Man is accounted to be the <note place="margin">X. <hi>The Will unforc'd.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Author</hi> of his <hi>own Actions,</hi> becauſe they are voluntarily undertaken by himſelf; ſo this is chiefly to be obſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Will, to wit, that its <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneity</hi> or natural Freedom is at leaſt to be aſſerted in thoſe Actions, concerning which a man is wont to give an Account before any human Tribunal. For where an abſolute <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>choice</hi> is wholly taken away, there not the man who <hi>acts,</hi> but he that <hi>impoſed</hi> upon him the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſo doing, is to be reputed the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of that Action, to which the other unwillingly miniſtred with his ſtrength and Limbs.</p>

FURTHERMORE, though the Will <note place="margin">XI. <hi>The Will variouſly affected.</hi>
                     </note> do always deſire good in general, and has continually an Averſion for <hi>Evil</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in general; yet a great <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> may be found among men. And this ariſes from hence, that all things that are good and evil do not appear <hi>purely</hi> ſo to Man, but <hi>mixt</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the good with the bad and the bad with the good; and becauſe different Objects do particularly affect divers parts, as it were, of a Man; for inſtance, ſome regard that good Opinion and Reſpect that a Man has for himſelf; ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the outward Senſes; and ſome that Love of himſelf, from which he deſires his own Preſervation. From whence it is, that thoſe of the firſt ſort appear to him as <hi>decorous;</hi> of the ſecond as <hi>pleaſant;</hi> and of the laſt as <hi>profitable:</hi> And accordingly as each of theſe have made a powerful Impreſſion upon a Man, it brings upon him a peculiar propenſity that way-ward; whereto may be added the particular <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> and <hi>Averſions</hi> that are in moſt Men to ſome certain things. From all which it comes to paſs, that upon any Action ſeveral <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> offer themſelves, which either <hi>are</hi> true or <hi>appear</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59922:24"/>
ſo; which ſome have more, ſome leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to diſtinguiſh with ſolidity of Judgment. So that 'tis no wonder that one man ſhould be carried eagerly on to that, which another perfectly abhors.</p>
                  <p>BUT neither is the Will of Man always <note place="margin">XII. <hi>The Will byaſs'd by Natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                     </note> found to ſtand <hi>equally</hi> poiſed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to every Action, that ſo the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to this or that ſide ſhould come only from an <hi>internal Impulſe,</hi> after a due conſideration had of all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but it is very often puſht on one way rather than another by <hi>ſome outward Movements.</hi> For, that we may paſs by that univerſal Propenſity to Evil, which is in all Mortals, the Original and Nature of which belong to the Examination of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note n="*" place="margin">The Judgment of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</note> 
                     <hi>Forum;</hi> firſt, a <hi>peculiar diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature</hi> puts a particular kind of <hi>byaſs</hi> upon the Will, by which ſome are ſtrongly inclin'd to certain ſorts of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this is not only to be found in ſingle <hi>Men,</hi> but in whole <hi>Nations.</hi> This ſeems to proceed from the Temperature of the Air that ſurrounds us, and of the Soil; and from that Conſtitution of our Bodies which either was deriv'd to us in the Seed of our <hi>Parents,</hi> or was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd in us by our <hi>Age, Diet,</hi> the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59922:24"/>
want or enjoyment of <hi>Health,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Studies or <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Living</hi> and Cauſes of that ſort, beſide the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>formations</hi> of the <hi>Organs,</hi> which the <hi>Mind</hi> makes uſe of in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of its ſeveral Offices, and the like. And here, beſide that a man may with due eare very much <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>temperament</hi> of his body and <hi>repreſs</hi> the exorbitances of his natural <hi>Inclination,</hi> it is to be noted, that how much power ſoever we attribute hereto, yet it is not to be underſtood to be of that force as to hurry a man into ſuch a violation of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> as ſhall render him obnoxious to the <hi>Civil Judicature,</hi> where evil <hi>Deſires</hi> are not animadverted on, provided they break not forth into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Actions.</hi> So that after all the pains that can be taken to repel Nature, if it take its full ſwinge, yet it may ſo far be reſtrain'd as not to produce <hi>open Acts</hi> of Wickedneſs; and the <hi>Difficulty</hi> which happens in vanquiſhing thoſe Propenſities is abundantly recompenſed in the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Conqueſt. But if theſe Impulſes are ſo ſtrong upon the mind, that they cannot be contained from breaking forth, yet there may be found a way, as it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59922:25"/>
were to draw them off, without Sin.</p>
                  <p>THE frequent <hi>Repetition</hi> of Actions of <note place="margin">XIII. <hi>By Cuſtom.</hi>
                     </note> the ſame kind does alſo <hi>incline</hi> the Will to do certain things; and the Propenſity which proceeds from hence is called <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> for it is by this that any thing is undertaken readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, ſo that the Object being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Mind ſeems to be forced thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or if it be abſent, the ſame is earneſtly deſirous of it. Concerning which this is to be obſerved, that as there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be no <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> but what a Man may by applying a due Care, <hi>break</hi> and <hi>leave off;</hi> ſo neither can any ſo far put a force upon the Will, but that a Man may be able at any time to reſtrain himſelf from any <hi>external Acts</hi> at leaſt, to which by that he is urged. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was in the perſons <hi>own Power</hi> to have contracted this <hi>Habit</hi> or no, whatſoever eaſineſs it brings to any Action, yet if that Action be good, it loſes nothing of its value therefore, as neither doth an evil thing abate ought of its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. But as a <hi>good Habit</hi> brings <hi>Praiſe</hi> to a man, ſo an <hi>ill</hi> one ſhews his <hi>Shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT is alſo of great conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">XIV. <hi>By Paſſion.</hi>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59922:25"/>
ſtate, or whether it be affected with thoſe peculiar Motions we call the <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Of theſe it is to be known, that how violent ſoever they are, a man with the right uſe of his <hi>Reaſon</hi> may yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them, or at leaſt contain them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bounds of <hi>Action.</hi> But whereas of the <hi>Paſſions</hi> ſome are raiſed from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Good,</hi> and others of <hi>Evil;</hi> and do urge either to the procuring of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is <hi>acceptable,</hi> or to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what is <hi>miſchievous,</hi> it is agreeable to Human Nature, that <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould meet among men more <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> than <hi>thoſe;</hi> and that according to ſuch degrees, as the Miſchief that excited them was more hurtful and intolerable. For to <hi>want</hi> a <hi>Good</hi> not altogether neceſſary to the preſervation of Nature is accounted more <hi>eaſie,</hi> than to <hi>endure an Evil</hi> which tends to Natures deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>FURTHERMORE, as there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">XV. <hi>By Intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
                     </note> Maladies, which take away all uſe of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> either perpetually or for a time, ſo 'tis cuſtomary in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for men on purpoſe to procure to themſelves a certain kind of <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> which goes off in a ſhort time, but which very much confounds the Reaſoning Faculty.

By this we mean <hi>Drunkenneſs;</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from certain kinds of Drink and Fumes, which incenſe and diſturb the Blood and Spirits, thereby rendring men very prone to <hi>Luſt, Anger, Raſhneſs</hi> and immoderate <hi>Mirth;</hi> ſo that many by <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> are ſet as it were beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſeem to have put on <hi>another Nature</hi> than that which they were of, when <hi>ſober.</hi> But as this does not always take away the <hi>whole</hi> uſe of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> ſo as far as the perſon does <hi>willingly</hi> put himſelf in this ſtate, it is apt to procure an <hi>Abhorrence</hi> rather than a <hi>favourable Interpretation</hi> of what is done by its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59922:26"/>
Diſſent and Averſion by Signs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by counterſtriving with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

Theſe Actions therefore are called <hi>mixt.</hi> With <hi>Voluntary Actions</hi> they have this in common, that in the preſent State of things the Will <hi>chuſes</hi> them as the leſſer Evil.

For there can be no truer reaſon why any Action
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59922:27"/>
ſhould be <hi>imputable</hi> to a Man, than that, he did it either mediately or immediately, <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>willingly;</hi> or that it was in his power to have done the ſame or to have let it alone. Hence it obtains as the prime Axiom in matters of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which are liable to the Human Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; That every man is accountable for all ſuch Actions, the performance or omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which were in his <hi>own Choice.</hi> Or, which is tantamount, That every Action, capable of human direction, is chargeable upon him who might or might not have done it. So on the contrary, no man can be reputed the Author of that Action, which neither in itſelf nor in its cauſe, was in <hi>his Power.</hi>

                  <p>NONE of thoſe Actions which are <note place="margin">The firſt Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> done by another <hi>man,</hi> nor any operation of whatſoever other <hi>things,</hi> neither any <hi>Accident,</hi> can be imputable to another perſon, but ſo far forth as it was in <hi>his</hi>

                     <hi>Power,</hi> or as he was <hi>obliged</hi> to guide ſuch Action. For nothing is more common in the world, than to <hi>ſubject</hi> the Doings of <hi>one Man</hi> to the Manage and Direction of <hi>another.</hi> Here then, if any thing be perpetrated by one, which had not been done, if the other had performed his <hi>Duty</hi> and exerted his <hi>Power;</hi> this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall not only be chargeable upon him who immediately did the fact, but upon the other alſo who <hi>neglected</hi> to make uſe of his <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> And yet this is to be underſtood with ſome reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo as that <hi>Poſſibility</hi> may be taken <hi>morally,</hi> and in a <hi>large</hi> ſenſe. For no <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> can be ſo <hi>ſtrict,</hi> as to extinguiſh <hi>all</hi> manner of <hi>liberty</hi> in the perſon ſubjected, but ſo that 'twill be in his Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and act quite contrary to the direction of his <hi>Superior;</hi> neither will the ſtate of <hi>Human Nature</hi> bear, that any one ſhould be perpetually affix'd to the ſide of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as to obſerve <hi>all</hi> his motions. Therefore when a <hi>Superiour</hi> has done eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that was required by the <hi>Rules</hi> of his <hi>Director-ſhip,</hi> and yet ſomewhat is acted amiſs, this ſhall be laid only to the charge of <hi>him</hi> that <hi>did</hi> it. Thus whereas <hi>Man</hi> exerciſes dominion over other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59922:28"/>
what is done by them to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, ſhall be charg'd upon the <hi>Owner,</hi> as ſuppoſing him to have been wanting of due <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Circumſpection.</hi> So alſo all thoſe Miſchiefs which are brought upon another, may be <hi>imputed</hi> to that perſon, who when he could and ought, yet did not take out of the way the Cauſe and Occaſion thereof. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it being in the power of Men to <hi>promote</hi> or <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the Operations of many <hi>Natural Agents,</hi> whatſoever Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or Damage is wrought by theſe, <hi>they</hi> ſhall be accountable for, by whoſe <hi>application</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> the ſame was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd. Beſide, ſometimes there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Caſes, when a man ſhall be charg'd with ſuch Events as are above human Direction, as when <hi>God</hi> ſhall do particular <hi>Works</hi> with regard to ſome <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> perſon. Theſe and the like Caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excepted, for all the reſt it ſuffices, if a Man can give an Account of his <hi>own doings.</hi>

Defect, or does not rowſe up his native Faculties. So becauſe no man can give himſelf an <hi>Acuteneſs</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi> therefore no one is to be blamed for want of either, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for having them, except ſo far as he <hi>improv'd,</hi> or <hi>neglected</hi> the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating thereof. Thus <hi>Clowniſhneſs</hi> is not blameable in a Ruſtic, but in a <hi>Courtier</hi> or <hi>Citizen.</hi> And hence it is, that thoſe Reproaches are to be judg'd extremely abſurd, which are grounded upon Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the Cauſes of which are not in our power, as, <hi>Short Stature,</hi> a <hi>deform'd Countenance</hi> and the like.</p>

Becauſe we cannot properly <hi>direct</hi> our Action, unleſs by the Light of the Underſtanding; (and 'tis here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Man is unable to procure ſuch Light) neither are we to blame that we cannot. Now in the common affairs of Life, the word <hi>Poſſible</hi> is to be morally underſtood, and by <hi>Ability</hi> is meant that <hi>Faculty, Diligence</hi> and <hi>Circumſpection</hi> which is commonly judg'd to <hi>ſuffice,</hi> and which is well ſupported with probable reaſons.</p>

                     <hi>Laws</hi> and that <hi>Duty,</hi> which is incumbent upon every man, does not excuſe from blame.

And theſe Laws and Rules of Duty generally are and ſhould be ordered to the <hi>Capacity</hi> of ſuch <hi>Subject,</hi> if they are ſuch as he is oblig'd to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>remember.</hi> Hence, he who is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Ignorance</hi> ſhall be bound to anſwer for thoſe <hi>Actions</hi> which are the effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>HE who, not by his own fault, wants <note place="margin">XXII. <hi>The fifth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                     </note> an <hi>opportunity</hi> of doing his <hi>Duty,</hi> ſhall not be accountable, becauſe he has not done it. Now to a fair occaſion theſe four things are requiſite; 1. That an <hi>Object</hi> of Action be ready: 2. That a proper <hi>Place</hi> be had, where we may not be hindred by others, or receive ſome Miſchief: 3. That we have a fit <hi>Time,</hi> when buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of greater Neceſſity is not to be done, and which may be ſeaſonable for other matters which concur to the Action: and 4. laſtly, That we have natural <hi>Force ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> for the performance. For ſince an Action cannot be atchiev'd without theſe, 'twould be abſurd to blame a man for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59922:29"/>
not acting, when he had not an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſo to do. Thus a Phyſician can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accuſed of <hi>Sloth,</hi> when no body is ſick to employ him. Thus no man can be liberal, who wants it himſelf. Thus he cannot be reproved for burying his talent, who having taken a due care to ſet himſelf in a uſeful Station, has yet miſs'd of it: though it be ſaid, <hi>To whom much is given, from him much ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi> Thus we cannot blow and ſuck all at once.</p>
                  <p>NO man is <hi>accountable</hi> for not doing <note place="margin">XXIII. <hi>The ſixth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                     </note> that which <hi>exceeded</hi> his <hi>Power,</hi> and which he had not ſtrength ſufficient to hinder or accompliſh.

For it is ſuppoſed, that 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his power to decline or avoid ſuch doing or ſuffering. But we are ſaid after a twofold manner to be <hi>compell'd;</hi> one way is, when another that's ſtronger than us <hi>violently forces</hi> our Members to do or endure ſomewhat: the other, when one more powerful ſhall <hi>threaten</hi> ſome grievous Miſchief (which he is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately able to bring upon us) unleſs we will, as of our own accord, apply our ſelves to the doing of this, or abſtain from doing that.

                  <p>THIS Rule is called Law; which is <note place="margin">II. <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </note> a Decree by which the Superior obliges one that is ſubject to him, to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date his Actions to the directions preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed therein.</p>

THAT this Definition may the better <note place="margin">III. <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </note> be underſtood, it muſt firſt be enquired, What is an <hi>Obligation? whence</hi> is its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal? <hi>who</hi> is capable of <hi>lying under</hi> an Obligation? and <hi>who</hi> it is that can <hi>impoſe</hi> it? <hi>Obligation</hi> then is uſually ſaid to be that rightful Bond, by which a man is neceſſitated to do ſomewhat. That is, hereby a <hi>Bridle,</hi> as it were is put upon our <hi>Liberty;</hi> ſo that though the <hi>Will</hi> does actually drive <hi>another</hi> way, yet we find our ſelves hereby ſtruck as it were with an <hi>internal</hi> Senſe, that if our Action be not perform'd according to the <hi>preſcript Rule</hi> we cannot but confeſs we have not done <hi>right;</hi> and if any miſchief happen to us upon that account, we may fairly charge <hi>our ſelves</hi> with the ſame; becauſe it might have been avoided, if the <hi>Rule</hi> had been follow'd as it ought.</p>
                  <p>AND there are two reaſons why <hi>Man</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</hi>
                     </note> ſhould be ſubject to an <hi>Obligation;</hi> one is, becauſe he is endow'd with a <hi>Will,</hi> which may be divers ways <hi>directed,</hi> and ſo be <hi>conform'd</hi> to a Rule; the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Man</hi> is not exempt from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a <hi>Superior.</hi> For where the <hi>Faculties</hi> of any Agent are by <hi>Nature</hi> form'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>one way</hi> of acting, there 'tis to no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59922:32"/>
purpoſe to expect any thing to be done of choice: and to ſuch a Creature 'tis <hi>in vain</hi> to preſcribe any <hi>Rule;</hi> becauſe 'tis uncapable of <hi>underſtanding</hi> the ſame or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> its actions thereto. Now if there be any one who has no <hi>Superior,</hi> then there is no power that can of right impoſe a Neceſſity upon him; and if he perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves a certain Rule in what he does, and conſtantly abſtains from doing many things, he is not to be underſtood to act thus from any <hi>Obligation</hi> that lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>him,</hi> but from his own <hi>good pleaſure.</hi> It will follow then, that <hi>He</hi> ſhould be capable of Obligation, who has a <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> and is able to <hi>underſtand</hi> the Rule preſcribed, and is endued with a <hi>Will</hi> which may be <hi>directed</hi> ſeveral ways; and yet which (when the Law is promulg'd by his Superior) knows he cannot rightly depart therefrom.

Now when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59922:33"/>
any man has either of theſe, as ſoon as he has ſignified what he would have, it neceſſarily ſtirs up in the mind of the party concern'd <hi>Fear</hi> mixt with <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> towards the firſt in contemplation of his <hi>Power;</hi> and toward the ſecond for the ſake of thoſe <hi>other Reaſons,</hi> which even without <hi>Fear,</hi> ought to allure any man to a compliance with his Will. For he that can give me no <hi>other reaſon</hi> for putting me under an Obligation againſt my Will, beſide this, that he's too <hi>ſtrong</hi> for me, he truly may ſo terrifie me, that I may think it better to <hi>obey</hi> him for a while than ſuffer a <hi>greater Evil;</hi> but when this <hi>Fear</hi> is over, nothing any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hinders, but that I may act after my <hi>own choice</hi> and not <hi>his.</hi> On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he that has nothing but <hi>Arguments</hi> to prove that I ſhould obey him, but wants <hi>Power</hi> to do me any Miſchief, if I deny. I may with Impunity ſlight his commands, except one more potent take upon him to make good his deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Authority, Now the <hi>Reaſons</hi> upon which one man may <hi>juſtly</hi> exact <hi>Subjection</hi> from another, are; If he have been to the other the <hi>Original</hi> of ſome extraordinary <hi>Good;</hi> and if it be plain, that he deſigns

And as to the <hi>Laws</hi> of a mans <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> the Subject has notice given of them by a <hi>Publication</hi> plainly and openly made. In which theſe two things ought to be aſcertain'd, that the <hi>Author</hi> of the Law is he, who hath the <hi>ſupreme Authority</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59922:34"/>
in the Community, and that this or that is the true meaning of the <hi>Law.</hi> The firſt of theſe is known, if he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge the Law with his <hi>own Mouth,</hi> or deliver it under his <hi>own Hand;</hi> or elſe if the ſame be done by ſuch as are <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> to that purpoſe by him: whoſe Authority 'tis in vain to call in queſtion, if it be manifeſt, that ſuch their acting belongs to that <hi>Office</hi> they bear in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that they are <hi>regularly plac'd</hi> in the Adminiſtration thereof; if theſe Laws are to be put <hi>judicially</hi> in Execution, and if they contain nothing <hi>derogatory</hi> to the <hi>Sovereign Power.</hi> That the latter, that is, the true <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> be known, it is the Duty of thoſe who promulge it, in ſo doing to uſe the greateſt <hi>Perſpicuity</hi> and <hi>Plainneſs;</hi> and if any thing <hi>obſcure</hi> do occur therein, an <hi>Explanation</hi> is to be ſought of the <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> or of thoſe who are <hi>publickly conſtituted</hi> to give judgment according to Law.</p>
                  <p>OF every <hi>perfect Law</hi> there are two <note place="margin">VII. <hi>Two parts of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law.</hi>
                     </note> parts: One, whereby it is directed <hi>what</hi> is to be <hi>done</hi> or <hi>omitted:</hi> the other, wherein is declared what <hi>puniſhment</hi> he ſhall incur, who <hi>neglects</hi> to do what is commanded, or <hi>attempts</hi> that which is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59922:34"/>
prohibited. For as, through the Pravity of Human Nature ever inclining to things forbidden, it is to no purpoſe to ſay, <hi>Do this,</hi> if no Puniſhment ſhall be undergone by him who diſobeys; ſo it were <hi>abſurd</hi> to ſay, <hi>You ſhall be puniſh'd,</hi> except ſome reaſon preceded, by which a Puniſhment was deſerv'd. Thus then all the force of a Law conſiſts in ſignifying what the <hi>Superior requires</hi> or <hi>forbids</hi> to be done, and what <hi>Puniſhment</hi> ſhall be inflicted upon the Violators. But the power of <hi>obliging,</hi> that is, of impoſing an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Neceſſity; and the power of <hi>forcing,</hi> or by the propoſal of Puniſhments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Obſervation of Laws, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the Legiſlator, and in him to whom the Guardianſhip and Execution of the Laws is committed.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER is enjoyn'd by any <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Other Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials.</hi>
                     </note> Law ought not only to be in the <hi>power</hi> of him to perform on whom the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is laid, but it ought to contain ſomewhat <hi>advantageous</hi> either to him or others. For as it would be <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> to exact the doing of any thing from another, under a Penalty, which it is and always was beyond his <hi>power</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; ſo it would be ſilly and to <hi>no</hi>

impoſſible that <hi>all Caſes,</hi> by reaſon of their infinite <hi>Variety,</hi> ſhould be either foreſeen or explicitely provided for; therefore the <hi>Judges,</hi> whoſe office it is to apply the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Rules of the Laws to <hi>ſpecial</hi> Caſes, ought to except ſuch from the Influence of them, as the <hi>Lawgiver himſelf</hi> would have excepted, if he were <hi>preſent,</hi> or had <hi>foreſeen</hi> ſuch Caſes.</p>

As for <hi>Justice</hi> it is ſometimes the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <note place="margin">XII. <hi>Juſtice of Perſons.</hi>
                     </note> of <hi>Actions,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Perſons.</hi> When it is attributed to <hi>Perſons,</hi> 'tis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually defin'd to be, A conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>deſire</hi> of giving every one their own. For he is call'd a <hi>juſt</hi> man, who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in doing righteous things, who ſtudies Juſtice, and in all his Actions endeavours to do that which is right. On the other ſide, the <hi>unjuſt</hi> man is he that neglects the giving every man his own, or, if he does, 'tis not becauſe 'tis due, but from expectation of Advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. So that a <hi>juſt man</hi> may ſometimes do unjuſt things, and an <hi>unjuſt man</hi> that which is juſt. But the <hi>juſt</hi> does that which is right, becauſe he is ſo <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the Law; and acts the contrary only through <hi>Infirmity;</hi> whereas the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> man does a juſt thing for fear of the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which is the Sanction of the Command, but he acts wrongfully from the <hi>naughtineſs</hi> of his <hi>heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT when Juſtice is attributed to <note place="margin">XIII. <hi>Of Actions.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Actions,</hi> then it is nothing elſe but a right application of the ſame to the Perſon. And a juſt Action done of choice, or knowingly and wittingly, is applied to the perſon to whom it is due. So that the

                     <hi>Juſtice</hi> of Actions differs from <hi>Goodneſs</hi> chiefly in this, that the latter ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes an agreement with the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Juſtice alſo includes the regard they have to thoſe perſons upon whom they are exerciſed. Upon which account Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is called a <hi>Relative Virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MEN do not generally agree about <note place="margin">XIV. <hi>Diviſion of Juſtice.</hi>
                     </note> the Diviſion of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The moſt receiv'd Diſtinction is, into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi> The firſt is, when <hi>every Duty</hi> is practiſed and <hi>all right</hi> done to others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that which could not have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by force, or by the rigor of Law. The latter is, when <hi>that Juſtice</hi> only is done a man, which in his own right he could have <hi>demanded;</hi> and this is wont to be again divided into <hi>Diſtributive</hi> and <hi>Commutative.</hi> The <hi>Diſtributive</hi> takes place in Contracts made between a Society and its Members concerning fair partition of Loſs and Gain according to a rate. The <hi>Commutative</hi> is moſtly in Bargains made upon even hand about things and doings relating to Traffick and Dealing.</p>
                  <p>KNOWING thus, what <hi>Juſtice</hi> is, <note place="margin">XV. <hi>Injuſtice what.</hi>
                     </note> 'tis eaſie to collect what is <hi>Injuſtice.</hi> Where it is to be obſerv'd, that ſuch an unjuſt Action is called <hi>Wrong-doing,</hi> which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59922:37"/>
is premeditately undertaken, and by which a violence is done upon ſomewhat which of abſolute right was another mans due, or which by like right he one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtood poſſeſs'd of. And this Wrong may be done after a threefold manner, 1. if that be denied to another which in his own right he might demand (not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting that which from Courteſie or the like Virtue may be anothers due); or 2. if that be taken away from another, of which by the ſame right then valid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Invader, he was in full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or 3. if any damage be done to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which we had not authority to do to him. Beſide which, that a man may be charg'd with <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that there be a naughty <hi>mind</hi> and an evil <hi>deſign</hi> in him that acts it. For if there be nothing of theſe in it, then 'tis only call'd <hi>Misfortune</hi> or a <hi>Fault,</hi> and that is ſo much ſlighter or more grievous, as the Sloth and Negligence which occaſion'd it was greater or leſs.</p>
                  <p>LAWS with reſpect to their Authors <note place="margin">XVI. <hi>Laws di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht.</hi>
                     </note> are diſtinguiſh'd into <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane;</hi> that proceeds from <hi>God,</hi> and this from <hi>Men,</hi> But if Laws be conſidered, as they have a neceſſary and univerſal Congruity
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59922:37"/>
with Mankind, they are then diſtinguiſht into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Poſitive.</hi> The former is that which is ſo agreeable with the <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and ſociable Nature of Man, that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> and <hi>peaceable Society</hi> could not be kept up amongſt Mankind without it. Hence it is, that <hi>this</hi> may be ſought out and the knowledge of it acquir'd by the light of that <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is born with every man, and by a conſideration of <hi>Human Nature</hi> in general. The <hi>latter</hi> is that which takes not its riſe from the common condition of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> but only from the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Legiſlator;</hi> not that this ought to be without its reaſon, but ſhould carry with it advantage to thoſe men or that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, for which it is deſign'd.

without which it falls to pieces, are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Laws of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FROM what has been ſaid it appears, <note place="margin">IX. <hi>The Means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd where the End is ſo.</hi>
                     </note> that this is a <hi>fundamental Law of Nature,</hi> That every man ought, as much as in him lies, to preſerve and promote <hi>Society,</hi> that is, the <hi>Welfare of Mankind.</hi> And, ſince he that deſigns the <hi>End,</hi> cannot but be ſuppoſed to deſign thoſe <hi>Means</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the <hi>End</hi> cannot be obtain'd, it follows that all ſuch Actions as tend generally and are abſolutely neceſſary to the preſervation of this <hi>Society,</hi> are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> by the Law of Nature; as on the contrary thoſe that diſturb and diſſolve it are forbidden by the ſame. All other Precepts are to be accounted only <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,</hi> or <hi>Conſequences</hi> upon this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Law, the Evidence whereof is made out by that Natural Light which is engrafted in Mankind.</p>

                     </note> contain that which is for the general <hi>Good;</hi> yet that the ſame may obtain the force of <hi>Laws,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily be preſuppoſed, that there is a <hi>God,</hi> who governs all things by his Providence, and that He has enjoyned us Mortals, to obſerve theſe <hi>Dictates</hi> of our Reaſon as Laws, promulg'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59922:41"/>
by him to us by the powerful Mediation of that Light which is born with us. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we might perhaps pay ſome obedience to them in contemplation of their <hi>

                  <p>BUT that God is the Author of the <note place="margin">XI. <hi>The ſame farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> is thus demonſtrated (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Mankind only in its <hi>preſent</hi> State, without enquiring whether the <hi>firſt</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of us Mortals were <hi>different</hi> from this, nor <hi>how</hi> the Change was wrought.) Whereas our Nature is ſo framed, that Mankind cannot be preſerv'd without a <hi>ſociable Life,</hi> and whereas it is plain that the <hi>Mind of Man</hi> is capable of all thoſe Notions, which are <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to this purpoſe; and it is alſo manifeſt, that Men not only, like the other Creatures, owe their <hi>Original</hi> to God, but that He <hi>governs</hi> them, let their Condition be as it will, by the wiſdom of his <hi>Providence.</hi> Hence it follows, that it muſt be ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Will of God,</hi> that Man ſhould make uſe of thoſe Faculties with which he is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59922:42"/>
peculiarly endow'd beyond the Brutes, to the <hi>preſervation</hi> of his own Nature; and conſequently, that the Life of man ſhould be different from the lawleſs Life of the <hi>Irrational Creatures.</hi> And ſince this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be atchiev'd but by an Obſervance of the <hi>Law Natural,</hi> it muſt be underſtood that there is from God an obligation laid upon Man to pay obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hereto, as a Means not <hi>invented</hi> by the Wit or <hi>impoſed</hi> by the Will of Men, nor capable of being <hi>chang'd</hi> by their Humours and Inclinations; but <hi>expreſly</hi> ordain'd by God himſelf in order to the <hi>accompliſhing</hi> this <hi>End.</hi> For he that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to perſue ſuch an <hi>End,</hi> muſt be thought to oblige us to make uſe of thoſe <hi>Means</hi> which are neceſſary to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. And that the <hi>Social Life</hi> is poſitively enjoyn'd by God upon <hi>Men,</hi> this is a Proof, that in no other <hi>Animal</hi> is to be found any Senſe of <hi>Religion</hi> or Fear of a <hi>Deity,</hi> which ſeems not ſo much as to fall within the Underſtanding of the ungovernable Brute; and yet it has the power to excite in the minds of <hi>Men,</hi> not altogether profligate, the tendereſt Senſe; by which they are convinc'd that by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt this <hi>Law Natural,</hi> they offend
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59922:42"/>
him who is Lord of the Soul of Man, and who is to be fear'd, even where we are ſecure of any Puniſhment from our Fellow-Creatures.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH it be uſually ſaid, that we <note place="margin">XII. <hi>This Law how writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Man's Heart.</hi>
                     </note> have the knowledge of this Law from <hi>Nature</hi> itſelf, yet this is not ſo to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as if there were implanted in the Minds of men juſt <hi>new-born</hi> plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Notions concerning what is to be <hi>done</hi> or <hi>avoided.</hi> But Nature is ſaid thus to teach us, partly becauſe the knowledge of this Law may be attain'd by the help of the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and partly becauſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and moſt uſeful points thereof are ſo <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> that they at firſt ſight force the Aſſent, and get ſuch root in the minds of men, that nothing can eradicate them afterwards; let wicked men take never ſo much pains to blunt the edge and ſtupifie themſelves againſt the Stings of their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> And in this Senſe we find in Holy Scripture, that this Law is ſaid to be <hi>written in the hearts of men.</hi> So that having from our Childhood had a ſenſe hereof inſtill'd into us together with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learning in the uſual Methods of Education, and yet not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>punctual time</hi> when firſt they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59922:43"/>
took hold of our Underſtandings and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed our Minds; we can have no other opinion of our knowledge of this Law; but that it was <hi>connate</hi> to our Beings, or born <hi>together</hi> and at the <hi>ſame time</hi> with our ſelves. The Caſe being the ſame with every man in learning his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THOSE <hi>Duties</hi> which from the Law of <note place="margin">XIII. <hi>Diviſion of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
                     </note> Nature are incumbent upon Man ſeem moſt aptly to be <hi>divided</hi> according to the <hi>Objects</hi> about which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant. With regard to which they are ranged under three principal heads; the <hi>firſt</hi> of which gives us directions how by the ſingle dictates of right Reaſon Man ought to behave himſelf towards <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> contains our Duty towards <hi>our ſelves;</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> that towards <hi>other men.</hi> But though thoſe Precepts of the Law Natural which have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>other</hi> men may primarily and directly be derived from that <hi>Sociality,</hi> which we have laid down as a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet even the Duties of Man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God</hi> may be indirectly deduced from thence, upon this account that the ſtrongeſt obligation to mutual Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man ariſes from <hi>Religion</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59922:43"/>
and a fear of the <hi>Deity;</hi> ſo as that Man could not become a <hi>ſociable</hi> Creature if he were not imbued with <hi>Religion;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Reaſon</hi> alone can go no farther in <hi>Religion</hi> than as it is uſeful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the common Tranquillity and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality or reciprocal Union in this Life: For ſo far forth as Religion procures the Salvation of Souls, it proceeds from peculiar Divine Revelation. But the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a man owes to <hi>Himſelf</hi> ariſe jointly from <hi>Religion</hi> and from the Neceſſity of <hi>Society.</hi> So that no man is ſo Lord of himſelf, but that there are many things relating to <hi>himſelf,</hi> which are not to be diſpoſed altogether according to his Will; partly becauſe of the obligation he lies under of being a religious Adorer of the Deity, and partly that he may keep himſelf a uſeful and beneficial Member of <hi>Society.</hi>

                  <p>THE Duty of Man towards God, <note place="margin">I. <hi>Natural Religion, its parts.</hi>
                     </note> ſo far as can be diſcovered by Natural Reaſon, is comprehended in theſe two; that we have true Notions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or <hi>know</hi> him aright; and then that we conform our Actions to his Will, or <hi>obey</hi> him as we ought. And hence Natural Religion conſiſts of two ſorts of Propoſitions, to wit, <hi>Theoretical</hi> or Speculative, and <hi>Practical</hi> or Active.</p>
                  <p>AMONGST thoſe <hi>Notions</hi> that every man ought to have of God, the <hi>firſt</hi> of <note place="margin">II. <hi>That God is.</hi>
                     </note> all is, that he firmly believe his <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> that is, that there <hi>is</hi> indeed ſome <hi>ſupreme</hi> and <hi>firſt Being,</hi> upon whom this Univerſe depends. And this has been moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated by learned and wiſe men, from the <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Cauſes</hi> to one another, which muſt at laſt be found to have their Original in ſomewhat that was before them all; from the nature of <hi>Motion;</hi> from the conſideration of this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59922:44"/>
great <hi>Machin,</hi> the World, and from the like Arguments. Which if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies himſelf to be able to <hi>comprehend,</hi> he is not therefore to be excuſed for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm. For all Mankind having been perpetually, as it were, poſſeſſed of this perſuaſion, that man who undertakes to oppoſe it, ought not only ſolidly to <hi>confute</hi> all thoſe Arguments that are brought to <hi>prove</hi> a God, but ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <hi>Reaſons</hi> for his own Aſſertion which may be <hi>more plauſible</hi> than thoſe. And ſince by this Belief of the <hi>Deity</hi> the Weal of Mankind may be ſuppoſed to have been <hi>hitherto</hi> preſerved, he ought ro ſhew that Atheiſm would <hi>better</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that end than ſober Religion and the Worſhip of God. Now ſeeing this can by no means be done, the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe men who attempt any way to eradicate this Perſuaſion out of the minds of men, is to be above all things abominated, and reſtrained by the ſevereſt Puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>THE Second is, that <hi>God is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. <hi>God the Creator of the World.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> For it being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from Reaſon, that none of theſe things could exiſt of <hi>themſelves,</hi> it is abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59922:45"/>
have ſome ſupreme <hi>Cauſe;</hi> which <hi>Cauſe</hi> is the very ſame that we call GOD. And hence it follows, that thoſe men are chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who every now and then are put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon us <hi>Nature,</hi> forſooth, as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cauſe of all Things and Effects. For, if by that Word they mean that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy</hi> and <hi>power of acting</hi> which we find in every thing, this is ſo far from being of any force to prove there is <hi>no God,</hi> that it proves Him to be the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>it ſelf.</hi> But if by <hi>Nature</hi> they would have us underſtand the <hi>Supreme Cauſe</hi> of all things, this is only out of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Nicety to avoid the receiv'd and plain appellation of GOD. Thoſe alſo are in a great Error, who believe that any thing can be GOD, which is the Object of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Stars,</hi> among the reſt. For the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of theſe argues them all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their beings from ſomewhat elſe, and not to be the <hi>firſt</hi> things in nature. Nor do they think leſs unworthily of <hi>God</hi> who call him the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> For the Soul of the World, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it as they pleaſe, muſt ſignifie a <hi>Part</hi> of the World; and how can a <hi>Part</hi> of a thing be the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59922:45"/>
is, be ſomething <hi>before</hi> itſelf. But if by the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World, they mean that <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>inviſible Being,</hi> from which all things receive their Vigour, Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they only obtrude upon us an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and figurative Word for one that is plain and obvious. From hence alſo it appears, that the <hi>World</hi> did not exiſt from <hi>all Eternity;</hi> this being contrary to the nature of that which has a <hi>Cauſe.</hi> And he that aſſerts that the <hi>World is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> denies that it had any <hi>Cauſe</hi> of its being, and conſequently denies <hi>God</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>THE Third is, that God <hi>governs the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IV. <hi>God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>whole World,</hi> and particularly <hi>Mankind:</hi> Which plainly appears from the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſtant <hi>Order</hi> which is to be ſeen in this Univerſe; and 'tis to the ſame <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> purpoſe whether a man deny that <hi>God is,</hi> or that he <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>regards the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Men;</hi> ſince either of them deſtroy all manner of Religion. For let him be never ſo excellent in himſelf, 'tis in vain to fear or worſhip him, if he be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regardleſs of us, and neither will nor can do us either good or hurt.</p>
                  <p>THE Fourth is, that <hi>no Attribute can</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">V. <hi>God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>belong to God, which implies any manner of</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59922:46"/>
                     <hi>Imperfection.</hi> For it would be abſurd, He being the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Source</hi> of all things, for any Creature of his to think itſelf able to form a notion of any <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> of which he is not fully poſſeſs'd. Nay, His <hi>Perfection</hi> infinitely ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Capacity of ſo mean a Creature, it is moſt reaſonable to expreſs the ſame in <hi>negative</hi> rather than in <hi>poſitive</hi> terms. Hence nothing is to be attributed to God that is <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>determinate;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is <hi>finite</hi> has always ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is <hi>greater</hi> than itſelf: and whatſoever is <hi>determinate</hi> or ſubject to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> muſt ſuppoſe <hi>Bounds</hi> and <hi>Circumſcription.</hi> Neither can He be ſaid to be <hi>diſtinctly</hi> and <hi>fully comprehended</hi> or conceived in our Imagination, or by any Faculty of our Souls; becauſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we can comprehend fully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in our Minds, muſt be <hi>Finite.</hi> And yet when we pronounce God to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> we are not to think we have a full <hi>Notion</hi> of Him, for by the word <hi>Infinite</hi> we denote nothing in the Thing itſelf, but only declare the Impotence of our Underſtandings, and we do, as it were, ſay, that we are not able to comprehend the Greatneſs of his Eſſence
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59922:46"/>
Hence alſo it is, that we cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of God that he has any <hi>Parts,</hi> as neither that <hi>He</hi> is <hi>All</hi> any thing; for theſe are Attributes of things <hi>finite;</hi> nor that he is contained in any <hi>Place,</hi> for that denotes limits and bounds; nor that he <hi>moves</hi> or <hi>reſts,</hi> for both thoſe ſuppoſe him to be in a place: So neither can any thing be properly attributed to God which intimates <hi>Grief</hi> or any <hi>Paſſion,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Anger, Repentance, Mercy.</hi> I ſay <hi>properly;</hi> becauſe when we find ſuch things ſaid of Him, they are to be ſuppoſed to have their ſignification from the <hi>Effect</hi> and not from any <hi>Emotion</hi> in the Mind of the Deity, the Expreſſion being only conform'd to <hi>Humane Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</hi> Nor may we ſay of Him ought that denotes the <hi>Want</hi> or Abſence of any Good, as <hi>Appetite, Hope, Concupiſcence, Deſire</hi> of any thing; for theſe imply <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence</hi> and conſequently <hi>Imperfection,</hi> it not being ſuppoſable that one ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, hope or crave any thing of which he does not ſtand in ſome need. And ſo when <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Will, Knowledge,</hi> and Acts of the <hi>Senſes,</hi> as Seeing, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are attributed to God, they are to be taken in a much more ſublime
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59922:47"/>
ſenſe, than we conceive them in out ſelves. For the <hi>Will</hi> is a <hi>rational Deſire;</hi> but <hi>Deſire,</hi> as is ſaid afore, preſuppoſes the <hi>Want</hi> or <hi>Abſence</hi> of ſomething that is agreeable and neceſſary. And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> implies ſome Operation upon the Faculties of a Man, wrought by exterior Objects upon the Organs of his Body and the Powers of his Soul; which being ſigns of a Power <hi>depending</hi> upon ſome other thing, demonſtrate it not to be <hi>moſt perfect.</hi>

                     </note> the Defence of our ſelves may be made, it is to be two ways conſider'd, as in the <hi>two Caſes</hi> juſt before laid down. Where each party live in their <hi>Natural Liberty,</hi> although it may and ought to be <hi>preſum'd,</hi> that they will mutually comply with the Duties of the Law of Nature; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Pravity of Humane Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are not obliged to be ſo <hi>ſecure</hi> of themſelves, but they may ſeaſonably take care of their Safety by <hi>innocent Methods</hi> of Defence; as ſuppoſe, by fortifying their Avenues againſt any that ſhall pretend to act hoſtilites upon them; by providing Ammunition and liſting Men; by making Confederacies; by having a watchful Eye upon the deſigns of others, and the like. But this <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> which has its riſe from the Pravity of Humane Nature, is not ſo to be improv'd, as to give occaſion to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs others by Violence under pretext of Self-Defence; no, not tho I ſee my Neighbors <hi>Power</hi> to grow too <hi>great,</hi> eſpecially if ſuch Power has its increaſe from <hi>harmleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,</hi> or be the effect of the Bounty of <hi>Providence,</hi> without the Oppreſſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

a <hi>Deſign</hi> ſo to do not to <hi>me,</hi> but to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> I may not preſently without any more ado invade him in my own name; unleſs I am under an Alliance to aſſiſt that <hi>other</hi> who is aſſaulted by this greater <hi>Power.</hi> And then it goes farther in this Caſe, and makes it expedient to uſe greater Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in my Reſiſtance, if it be probable, that as ſoon as this <hi>great Power</hi> has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd the <hi>other,</hi> I am like to be <hi>next</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, and that the <hi>firſt Conqueſt</hi> he ſhall make is to be the Inſtrument of <hi>another</hi> which he intends. But again when it <hi>plainly</hi> appears, that another is <hi>making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> to invade me, though he have not openly <hi>declar'd</hi> his Intention, I may immediately enter upon <hi>violent Methods</hi> for my own Defence, and <hi>anticipate</hi> the Aggreſſor; ſuppoſing that he would not lay by his hoſtile Deſigns upon any <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advice,</hi> or that the <hi>propoſing</hi> ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may prove of ill conſequence to my affairs.

bring his Deſign to perfection. For it is not abſolutely neceſſary to <hi>Self-Defence</hi> that I <hi>receive</hi> the firſt ſtroke, or that I only <hi>ward off</hi> and <hi>avoid</hi> the Blows that are aim'd at me.</p>

                     </note> the liberties for <hi>Self-Defence</hi> ought not to be near ſo large.

and <hi>ſhewing</hi> plainly a <hi>deſign</hi> upon my Life, is got into a <hi>place</hi> where he is very capable of doing me a miſchief, allowing me ſome time, in which it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent rather than be prevented; although in <hi>foro humano</hi> a <hi>little Exceeding</hi> be not much minded in regard of the great diſturbance ſuch a danger muſt be thought to raiſe in the Spirit of Man.

For as for <hi>Revenge</hi> of the wrong done, and <hi>Caution</hi> for future Security, that belongs to the Care of the <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> and is to be done only by <hi>his</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

and Luſts are to be curb'd. It is alſo the <hi>moſt neceſſary,</hi> becauſe without it <hi>Human Society</hi> cannot be preſerv'd. For I can live quietly with him that does me no good, or with whom I have no manner of Correſpondence, provided he do me <hi>no harm.</hi> Nay this is all we deſire from the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of Mankind, the doing mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>good Offices</hi> lying but between a few.

                     <hi>any Harm or Damage be done to another, he who is truly chargeable as Author of the Wrong, ought as far as in him lies, to make Reparation.</hi> For otherwiſe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept would be to no purpoſe, That no man ſhall be hurt nor receive damage; if when he has actually ſuſtain'd a Miſchief, he muſt put it up quietly, and he who did the Injury ſhall enjoy <hi>ſecurely</hi> the Fruit of his Violence, without <hi>refunding.</hi> And ſetting aſide this <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the Pravity of Mans Nature is ſuch, that they would never forbear <hi>injuring</hi> one another, and it would be very hard for him who has ſuffer'd Wrong, to compoſe his mind ſo as to live peaceably with the other, till <hi>Reparation</hi> were made.</p>

Nay there ſeems to him to be ſomewhat of <hi>Dignity</hi> in the appellation of <hi>Man,</hi> ſo that the laſt and moſt efficacious Argument to curb the Arrogance of inſulting men, is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I am not a Dog, but a Man as well as your ſelf.</hi> Since then Humane Nature is the <hi>ſame</hi> in us all, and ſince no man will or can chearfully join in Society wity any, by whom he is not at leaſt to be eſteem'd equally as a Man and as a partaker of the ſame Common Nature: It follows that, among thoſe <hi>Duties which men owe to each other,</hi> this obtain the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, That <hi>every man eſteem and treat another, as</hi>

                     <hi>naturally equal to himſelf, or as one who is a Man as well as he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Equality</hi> of Mankind does <note place="margin">II. <hi>Where this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality conſiſts.</hi>
                     </note> not alone conſiſt in this, that men of ripe age have almoſt the ſame <hi>Strength,</hi> or if one be weaker he may be able to kill the ſtronger, either by <hi>Treachery,</hi> or <hi>Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> or by being better furniſh'd with <hi>Weapons;</hi> but in this, that though Nature may have accompliſh'd one man beyond another with various endowments of Body and Mind; yet nevertheleſs he is oblig'd to an obſervation of the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Law Natural</hi> towards the meaner perſon, after the ſame manner as <hi>himſelf</hi> expects the ſame from <hi>others;</hi> and has not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any greater liberty given him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon his Fellows. As on the other ſide the Niggardlineſs of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Fortune</hi> cannot of themſelves ſet any man ſo low, as that he ſhall be in a worſe condition as to the enjoyment of <hi>Common Right</hi> than others. But what <hi>one man</hi> may rightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand or expect from <hi>another,</hi> the ſame is due to <hi>others</hi> alſo (Circumſtances being alike) from <hi>him;</hi> and whatſoever <hi>one</hi> ſhall deem reaſonable to be done by <hi>others,</hi> the like it is moſt juſt he practiſe <hi>himſelf:</hi> For <hi>the Obligation of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                     <hi>Sociality among Mankind equally binds every man;</hi> neither may one man more than another violate the Law of Nature in any part. Not but that there are other <hi>popular Reaſons</hi> which illuſtrate this <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> to wit, that we are all deſcended of the <hi>ſame Stock;</hi> that we all are born, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and die after the <hi>ſame manner;</hi> and that God has not given any of us a <hi>certain Aſſurance</hi> that our happy Condition in the World ſhall not at any time be <hi>changed.</hi> Beſides, the Precepts of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion tell us that God favours not man for his Nobility, Power or Wealth, but for <hi>ſincere Piety,</hi> which may as well be found in a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> man, as in thoſe of <hi>high degree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from this <hi>Equality</hi> it follows, <note place="margin">III. <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for Service done.</hi>
                     </note> that he who would make uſe of other mens labour for his own benefit, ought to be ready to make a <hi>Recompence.</hi> For he who requires that other men ſhould do him kindneſſes, and expects <hi>himſelf</hi> to be <hi>free</hi> from doing the like, muſt be of opinion that thoſe other men are below himſelf, and not his <hi>Equals.</hi> Hence as thoſe perſons are the <hi>beſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of a Community, who without any difficulty allow the ſame things to their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59922:69"/>
Neighbor that themſelves require of him; ſo thoſe are altogether <hi>uncapable of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> who ſetting a high rate on themſelves in regard to others, will take upon 'em to act any thing towards their Neighbour, and expect a greater Reſpect than the reſt of Mankind, and demand a larger ſhare of matters to which no man has a claim, though they can make out no better Right than another: Whence this alſo is an univerſal Duty of the Law Natural, <hi>That no man, who has not a peculiar Right, ought to arrogate more to himſelf, than he is ready to allow to his fellows, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits other men to enjoy the ſame Equity with himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE ſame <hi>Equality</hi> alſo ſhews what <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
                     </note> every man's behaviour ought to be, when his buſineſs is to <hi>diſtribute Juſtice</hi> among others; to wit, that he treat them as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,</hi> and indulge not that, beſide the Merits of the Cauſe, to one, which he denies to another. For if he do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he who is diſcountenanc'd is at the ſame time affronted and wrong'd, and loſes ſomewhat of the Dignity which Nature beſtow'd upon him. Whence it follows, that things which are in common, are of right to be <hi>divided</hi> by equal parts among
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59922:70"/>
thoſe who are equal; where the Thing will not admit of <hi>Diviſion,</hi> they who are equally concerned, are to uſe it <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently;</hi> and, if the Quantity of the thing will bear it, as much as each party ſhall think fit; but if this cannot be allow'd, then it is to be uſed after a <hi>ſtated</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and <hi>proportionate</hi> to the Number of the Claimants; becauſe 'tis not poſſible to find out any other way of obſerving <hi>Equality.</hi> But if it be a Thing of that nature as not to be capable of being <hi>divided,</hi> nor of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſt in <hi>common,</hi> then it muſt be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>turns;</hi> and if this yet will not anſwer the point, and it is not poſſible the reſt ſhould be ſatisfied by an <hi>Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> the beſt way muſt be to determin Poſſeſſion by <hi>Lot;</hi> for in ſuch Caſes a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remedy cannot be thought on, as to removing all opinion of Partiality and Contempt of any party, and not deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the perſon whom Fortune does not favour.</p>
                  <p>THIS Duty is violated by <hi>Pride,</hi> when <note place="margin">V. <hi>Pride.</hi>
                     </note> one without any cauſe or for a cauſe not ſufficient, bears himſelf above his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and deſpiſes them as beneath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We ſay, <hi>without any Reaſon.</hi> For where a man is regularly poſſeſs'd of ſome <hi>Right,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59922:70"/>
which gives him a Preference to other men, he may lawfully <hi>make uſe of</hi> and <hi>aſſert</hi> the ſame, ſo it be without vain Oſtentation and the contempt of others; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary every one is with good reaſon to <hi>yield</hi> that <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> which is <hi>due</hi> to <hi>another.</hi> But for the reſt, <hi>true Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity</hi> has always for its Companion a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous Humility,</hi> which ariſes from a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on the Infirmity of our Nature, and the Faults, of which our ſelves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been or may hereafter be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are not leſs heinous than thoſe which may be committed by other men. The Inference we ought to make from hence, is, that we do not over-value our ſelves with regard to others, conſidering that <hi>they</hi> equally with us are endow'd with a <hi>free uſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> which they are alſo capable of managing to as <hi>good purpoſe:</hi> the <hi>regular <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that alone which a man can call <hi>his own,</hi> and upon which the <hi>true Value</hi> of Himſelf depends.

diffuſe themſelves far and near through all the inſtances of the Life of Man; yet <hi>that</hi> alone is not Ground ſufficient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fix all the Obligations which may be neceſſary to be made <hi>reciprocal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one and another. For all men are not endow'd with ſo much Good Nature, as that they will do all good Offices to every man out of <hi>mere kindneſs,</hi> except they have ſome certain expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>like</hi> again: and very often it happens that the Services we would have to be done to us by <hi>other men</hi> are of that ſort, that we cannot with <hi>Modeſty</hi> deſire them. Frequently alſo it may not <hi>become</hi> one of my Fortune or in my Station to be <hi>beholden</hi> to another for ſuch a thing. So that many times another cannot give, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we willing to accept, unleſs that other receive an <hi>Equivalent</hi> from us; and it happens not ſeldom, that my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor <hi>knows not</hi> how he may be ſerviceable to my occaſions. Therefore, that theſe <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good Offices,</hi> which are the Product of <hi>Sociality,</hi> may be more freely and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exerciſed, it was neceſſary that men ſhould agree among themſelves concerning what was to be done on this ſide and on that, which no man from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59922:76"/>
alone could have aſſur'd himſelf of. So that it was before-hand to be adjuſted what, this man doing <hi>ſo</hi> by his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he was to expect <hi>in lieu</hi> of the ſame, and which he might lawfully <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> This is done by means of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> and <hi>Contracts.</hi>

For without this a great part of that Advantage which might naturally accrew to Mankind by a <hi>mutual communication</hi> of good Offices and uſeful Things, would be loſt. And, but that an exact Obſervance of ones Promiſe is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> no man could propoſe to himſelf any <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in whatever he deſign'd, where he muſt depend upon the aſſiſtances of <hi>others.</hi> Beſides that Breach of Faith is apt to give the juſteſt occaſions to Quarrels and Wars. For if, according to my Agreement, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my part, and the other falſifie his word, whatſoever I have <hi>done</hi> or <hi>depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in expectation of his performance, is <hi>loſt.</hi> Nay, though I have done <hi>nothing</hi> as yet, yet it may be a Miſchief for me by this Diſappointment to have my <hi>Affairs</hi>

                  <p>BUT it is to be obſerv'd, that ſuch <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                     </note> things as are due to me only of <hi>Courteſie,</hi> differ from thoſe which I can claim on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a <hi>Contract</hi> or <hi>Promiſe,</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect chiefly: That, 'tis true, I may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire the honeſt performance of the <hi>firſt;</hi> but in this if the other ſhall neglect my Requeſt, I can only charge him with <hi>Rudeneſs, Cruelty</hi> or <hi>hard dealing;</hi> but I cannot <hi>compel</hi> him to do me reaſon either by my own Power or by any ſuperiour Authority.

Thus fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the principal Contract, which is <hi>expreſs,</hi> another is included which is <hi>tacit,</hi> the Nature of the Caſe ſo requiring: And it is uſual, in moſt Covenants that are made, that ſome <hi>tacit Exceptions</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Conditions</hi> muſt of neceſſity be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>BUT to render a man capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">X. <hi>Who cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59922:78"/>
muſt be ſaid of thoſe of <hi>Drunken men,</hi> if they are beſotted to that degree as that their Reaſon is overwhelm'd and ſtupefied. For it can never be accounted a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Conſent,</hi> if a man when his Brains are diſorder'd and intoxicated, ſhall on a ſudden and raſhly make fooliſh Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and give the uſual Demonſtrations of Conſent, which at <hi>another</hi> time would have <hi>oblig'd</hi> him: and it would be a piece of <hi>Impudence</hi> for any man to exact the performance of ſuch a Promiſe, eſpecially if it were of any conſiderable weight. But if one man ſhall lay hold on the <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> of anothers being drunk, and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily making an <hi>advantage</hi> of his Eaſineſs of Temper under thoſe Circumſtances, ſhall procure any Promiſe from him, this man is to be accounted guilty of a <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Knavery:</hi> Not but that, if, after the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Drink are over, he ſhall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> ſuch Promiſe, he ſhall be <hi>oblig'd;</hi> and this not with any regard to what he ſaid when <hi>drunk,</hi> but to his Confirmation when <hi>ſober.</hi>

For perſons of this Age, however perhaps they may well enough underſtand what they do, yet are prone to act with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Eagerneſs and Imprudence, and to be too free of their Promiſes, having great Aſſurance, deſiring to be accounted Liberal, apt to be obſtinate in the choice of their Companions, and not inclin'd to Warineſs and neceſſary Diſtruſt. So that he can hardly paſs for an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, who makes any advantage of the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of this Age, and would gain by the <hi>loſſes</hi> of <hi>young people,</hi> who for want of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience could not foreſee or place a true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimate thereon.</p>

CONSENT alſo may be rendred inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid <note place="margin">XII. <hi>Miſtake in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</hi>
                     </note> by a <hi>Miſtake</hi> or <hi>Error.</hi> Concerning which theſe Rules are to be obſerv'd. (1.) That when to my Promiſe, ſome <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> is ſuppoſed, without the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof I ſhould not have made ſuch Promiſe; the ſame ſhall, without the other, have no Obligation upon me: For in this Caſe the Promiſer does not engage <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> but upon a <hi>Condition,</hi> which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made good, the Promiſe becomes null and void. (2.) If I am drawn into a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain or Contract by a <hi>Miſtake,</hi> which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake I find before, as we uſe to ſay, Bulk is broke, or any thing done in order to the Conſummation thereof, it is but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that I ſhould be at liberty to retract; eſpecially if upon the Contract making, I plainly ſignified for what <hi>Reaſon</hi> I agreed to it; and that the other party ſuffers no <hi>damage</hi> by my going off from my Bargain, or, if he does, that I am ready to make <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi> But when, as was ſaid afore, Bulk is broke, and the <hi>Miſtake</hi> is not found till the Covenant is either wholly or in part already perform'd, the party who was under an Error cannot retract, any farther than the other ſhall of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie</hi> releaſe to him. (3.) When a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59922:80"/>
ſhall happen concerning the <hi>Thing,</hi> which is the <hi>Subject</hi> of the Contract, ſuch Contract is invalid, not for the ſake of the Miſtake, but becauſe the Bargain is not made good. For in Bargains of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Thing</hi> and all its <hi>Qualifications</hi> ought to be known, without which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg a fair Agreement cannot be ſuppoſed to be made. So that he who is like to ſuffer wrong by any Defect therein either may throw up his Bargain, or force the other to make the Thing as it ſhould be, or elſe to pay him the Value, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd through his Knavery or Negligence.</p>
                  <p>BUT if a man be drawn into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <note place="margin">XIII. <hi>Guileful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</hi>
                     </note> or Bargain by the <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> means of another; then the matter is thus to be conſider'd. (1.) If a <hi>third</hi> man were guilty of the Cheat, and the party with whom the Bargain is driven was not concern'd in it, the Agreement will be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid: but we may demand of him who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the Knavery ſo much as we are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers by being deceived. (2.) He who knaviſhly procures me to promiſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with him, ſhall not ſet me under any Obligation. (3.) If a man will indeed come freely with a plain <hi>deſign</hi> to drive a Bargain, but in the very <hi>Action</hi> ſhall have a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59922:80"/>
Trick put upon him; ſuppoſe, in the <hi>Thing</hi> bargain'd for, its Qualities or Value; the Contract ſhall be ſo far naught, as to leave it in the power of him who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, either to relinquiſh his Bargain, or to require ſatisfaction for his loſs. (4.) If unfair dealing chance to be uſed in ſome things not <hi>eſſential</hi> to the buſineſs, and which were not <hi>expreſly under regard,</hi> this weakens not the Agreement, if for the reſt it be regularly made; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>one party</hi> might have an eye to it, whilſt he bargain'd, and his Opinion might be cunningly cheriſh'd till the Contract were perfectly tranſacted.</p>
                  <p>WHENSOEVER <hi>Fear</hi> is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <note place="margin">XIV. <hi>Contracts ſuſpicious.</hi>
                     </note> in Promiſes or Bargains, it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and may either be called a <hi>probable Suſpicion</hi> leſt we ſhould be deceived by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and this becauſe he is one who is very much addicted to unjuſt practices, or has ſufficiently intimated his fraudulent deſign; or elſe a <hi>panic Terror of the Mind,</hi> ariſing from ſome grievous Miſchief threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, except we make ſuch a Promiſe or Contract. Concerning the firſt ſort of <hi>Fear,</hi> (or <hi>Miſtruſt</hi> rather) theſe things are to be obſerved. (1.) He who truſts the Engagements of one who is <hi>notoriouſly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59922:81"/>
of his Word and Troth, acts very imprudently; but, for that reaſon only can have no remedy, but ſhall be obliged. (2.) When a Bargain is made, and no <hi>new Indications</hi> appear of any knaviſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, the ſame ſhall not be invalidated by any objection of Faults which were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known before the Agreement. For, that Reaſon which could not hinder the making of the Bargain, cannot excuſe the fulfilling of it. (3.) Where <hi>after</hi> the Bargain made, it appears plainly that the other perſon intends to clude his part of the Contract, as ſoon as I have perform'd mine; here I cannot be forc'd to comply firſt, till I am ſecure of a performance on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>As for the other ſort of <hi>Fear</hi> theſe <note place="margin">XV. <hi>Contracts through Fear.</hi>
                     </note> Rules are to be obſerved, (1.) <hi>Contracts</hi> entred into through <hi>Fear,</hi> occaſion'd by a <hi>third</hi> man ſhall be valid; for there is no defect in the other party to the Bargain, but he may recover of me what is his due, beſide that he is well worthy a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, if by his Interpoſition, he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd me from <hi>Fear</hi> of that other. (2.) All ſuch <hi>Covenants</hi> as are made out of <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Reverence</hi> of our lawful Superiours, or by the <hi>Awe</hi> we have for thoſe to whom we
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59922:81"/>
are very much beholden, ſhall be firm and good. (3.) Thoſe <hi>Bargains</hi> which are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and forcibly extorted from a man by the perſon to whom the Promiſe or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made, are invalid. For the <hi>Violence</hi> he unjuſtly uſes to ſet me under that <hi>Fear</hi> renders him uncapable of pretending to any Right againſt me on account of ſuch Action of mine. And whereas in other Caſes every man is bound to Reparation of what Wrong he ſhall do to another, this Reſtitution to which he is bound is underſtood as it were to take off any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation from ſuch Promiſe, ſince if what was promiſed were paid, it ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſtor'd.</p>

                     </note> but in Promiſes the <hi>Conſent</hi> ought to be <hi>reciprocal;</hi> that is, both the Promiſer and he to whom the Promiſe is made muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the thing. For if the latter ſhall not <hi>conſent,</hi> or refuſe to <hi>accept</hi> of what is offered, the thing promiſed remains ſtill in the power of the Promiſer. For he that makes an <hi>offer</hi> of any thing, cannot be ſuppoſed to intend to <hi>force</hi> it upon one that is <hi>unwilling</hi> to receive it, nor yet to <hi>quit</hi> his own title to it; therefore when the other <hi>denies</hi> acceptance, he who
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59922:82"/>
proffer'd it loſes nothing of his Claim there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. If the Promiſe was occaſion'd by a <hi>Requeſt</hi> before made, the ſame ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to oblige ſo long, as till ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt be expreſly <hi>revok'd;</hi> for in that caſe the thing will be underſtood to be <hi>accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beforehand;</hi> provided yet that what is offer'd be proportion'd to what was deſir'd. For if it be not, then an <hi>expreſs Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is requiſite; becauſe it may often do me no good to anſwer my Requeſt by halves.</p>
                  <p>AS for the <hi>Matter</hi> of our Promiſes <note place="margin">XVII. <hi>Impoſſible Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </note> and Contracts, it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that what we promiſe or make a bargain for be <hi>in our power</hi> to make good, and that ſo to do be not prohibited by any Law; otherwiſe we engage our ſelves either <hi>fooliſhly</hi> or <hi>wickedly.</hi> Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that <hi>no man is oblig'd to do things impoſſible.</hi> But if it be a thing which at the time of the Bargain-making was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and yet afterwards by ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent without any fault of the Contracter became altogether impoſſible, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſhall be null, if there be nothing as yet done in it; but if one party have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd ſomewhat towards it, what he has advanc'd is to be reſtor'd to him, or an
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59922:82"/>
Equivalent given; and if this cannot be done, by all means it is to be endeavour'd that he ſuffer no loſs thereby. For in Contracts that is principally to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which was <hi>expreſly</hi> in the Bargain; if this cannot be obtain'd it muſt ſuffice to give an <hi>Equivalent;</hi> but if neither can this be had, at leaſt the <hi>utmoſt care</hi> is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the party undergo no Damage. But where any man ſhall <hi>deſignedly</hi> or by ſome very <hi>blameable miſcarriage</hi> render himſelf uncapable of making good his part of the Bargain, he is not only oblig'd to uſe his utmoſt endeavour, but ought alſo to be <hi>puniſh'd,</hi> as it were, to make up the amends.</p>
                  <p>IT is alſo manifeſt that we cannot ſet <note place="margin">XVIII. <hi>

                     </note> our ſelves under any obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what is <hi>unlawful.</hi> For no man can engage himſelf farther than he hath <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority</hi> ſo to do. But that Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator who prohibits any Action by a Law takes away all legal power of undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and diſables any man from oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to perform it. For it would imply a Contradiction, to ſuppoſe, that from a Duty enjoin'd by the Laws ſhould flow an Obligation to do that which the ſame Laws forbid to be done. So that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59922:83"/>
he tranſgreſſes who promiſes to do what is unlawful, but he is doubly a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor who performs it. Hence alſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that neither are thoſe Promiſes to be kept, the obſervation of which will be <hi>miſchievous</hi> to him to whom they are made; becauſe it is forbidden by the Law-Natural to do hurt to any man, even though he do fooliſhly deſire it. And if a Contract be made to do ſome <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>baſe</hi> thing, neither ſhall be oblig'd to fulfil it. If ſuch filthy thing be done by one party purſuant to the Bargain, the other ſhall not be bound to give the Reward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed for; but if any thing be already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on that account, it cannot be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again.</p>
                  <p>AND then, it is plain, that ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements <note place="margin">XIX. <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other men,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and Bargains as we ſhall make of what belongs to <hi>other men</hi> are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſignificant, ſo far as they are not ours, but ſubject to the Will and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others. But if I promiſe thus, "I will uſe my endeavour that ſuch a man (always ſuppoſing him to be one not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely under my command) ſhall do ſo or ſo: then I am oblig'd by all methods morally poſſible, (that is, ſo far as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can fairly requeſt of me, and as will

For ſince neither any <hi>Words</hi> nor any particular <hi>ſtrokes</hi> form'd into <hi>Letters</hi> can <hi>naturally</hi> denote any certain <hi>Thing</hi> (otherwiſe all Languages and Characters for writing would be the ſame,) and hence the uſe of the Tongue would be to no purpoſe, if every man might call every <hi>Thing</hi> by what <hi>Name</hi> he pleaſed; it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary among thoſe who ſpeak the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that there be a <hi>tacit Agreement</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, that this certain Thing ſhall be ſo or ſo called and not otherwiſe.

be agreed upon, 'twill be impoſſible for one man to gather the Meaning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his Talk.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> conſiſts in this, that every man ought by his <hi>Words</hi> ſo to expreſs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other his <hi>Meaning,</hi> that he may be plainly <hi>underſtood.</hi> Not but that it is in a Mans power to be <hi>ſilent</hi> as well as to <hi>ſpeak;</hi> and whereas no man is bound to tell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one what he bears in his mind; it

                     <hi>Omniſcient</hi> and <hi>Almighty,</hi> it is abſurd to ſwear by any thing which we do not ſuppoſe to be <hi>inveſted with Divinity,</hi> in this ſenſe, as to call upon ſuch Thing to be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Oath and an Avenger of the Perjury: though 'tis true it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to <hi>name</hi> in Oaths <hi>ſome certain thing,</hi> by which a man may be ſaid to ſwear in this ſenſe, that he implores God, if he ſwears falſly, to execute his Vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thing chiefly, as being moſt dear and of greateſt value to him who ſwears. <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Forms how to be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated.</hi>

                  <p>IN Oaths the <hi>Form</hi> which is preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (by which the perſon ſwearing invokes God as a Witneſs and an Avenger,) is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59922:89"/>
to be <hi>accommodated to the Religion of the ſaid Swearer,</hi> that is, to that Perſuaſion and Opinion of God which he is of. For 'tis to no purpoſe to make a man ſwear by a God, whom he does not <hi>believe,</hi> and conſequently does not <hi>fear.</hi> But no man ſuppoſes himſelf to take an Oath in any other Form nor under any other Notion than that which is conſonant to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>his Religion,</hi> which in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the <hi>true.</hi> Hence alſo it is, that he who ſwears by <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> which yet himſelf takes to be true ones, ſhall how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be oblig'd, and if he break his word, ſhall be accounted guilty of Perjury. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſet the general Notion of the Deity before his Eyes, 'tis no matter what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Conceptions he might have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo having knowingly forſworn himſelf, he has as much as in him lay, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Reverence which is due to the Divine Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>THAT an Oath may be <hi>binding,</hi> 'tis <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi>
                     </note> neceſſary it be taken with <hi>Deliberation;</hi> Whence he ſhall not be oblig'd by an Oath who merely <hi>recites</hi> it, or ſpeaking in the <hi>firſt Perſon</hi> dictates the concept formal Words thereof to another who is to ſay after him. But he who ſhall <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59922:89"/>
himſelf as one that is about to <hi>ſwear ſolemnly,</hi> ſhall be oblig'd, whatſoever <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reſervations</hi> he all the while may har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his mind. For otherwiſe all Oaths, nay all Methods of mutual Obligation by the Intervention of the plaineſt Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications would be of no uſe to humane Life, if any man by his <hi>tacit Intention</hi> could hinder ſuch an Act from producing thoſe Effects which were the very Deſign of its being done.</p>
                  <p>OATHS do not of themſelves produce <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Oaths how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging.</hi>
                     </note> any new and particular Obligation, but are ſuperinduced upon an Obligation that was before valid, as an <hi>Acceſſional Strength</hi> to the <hi>Engagement.</hi> For always when we ſwear we have ſomewhat under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which not made good, we provoke the Divine Wrath upon our ſelves; and this 'twere abſurd to think, if it were not unlawful not to perform what is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and conſequently not oblig'd ſo to do beforehand. Though ſometimes it muſt be allow'd that the <hi>prime Engagement</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> too may be compriſed in the ſame Sentence, as thus, <hi>As God help me, I'll give you a hundred Pounds.</hi> Where the Oath is not ſuperfluous, albeit 'tis added to a Promiſe that was valid of it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59922:90"/>
ſelf. Becauſe though every good man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a bare Promiſe to oblige, yet 'tis look'd upon to be the more firm when 'tis reinforc'd with an Imprecation of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from above upon a Failure. Hence it follows, that any Acts which have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a <hi>flaw</hi> in themſelves, cannot be made obligatory by the Acceſſion of an Oath; as neither can a <hi>ſubſequent</hi> Oath avoid a <hi>former legitimate</hi> Engagement, or annul that Right which <hi>another</hi> may claim thereby; thus a man would ſwear in vain not to pay another perſon what is juſtly due to him: Nor will an Oath be of any validity, where it appears, that 'twas made by the Juror upon <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of a thing to be done which was not <hi>really ſo;</hi> and that he would not have ſo ſworn, had not he <hi>believed</hi> it to be done; eſpecially if he were <hi>cajoled</hi> into ſuch his Error by the <hi>Craft</hi> of him to whom the Oath was made: Neither ſhall he, who by ſetting me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>panick Fear</hi> forces me to take an Oath, have any good title to require my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Farthermore, an Oath ſhall have no Obligation upon me to do any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act,</hi> or to <hi>omit</hi> the performing any <hi>Duty</hi> enjoin'd by the Laws of God or Man. Laſtly, an Oath cannot <hi>alter</hi> the Nature
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59922:90"/>
or Subſtance of the Contract or Promiſe to which it is annex'd; Hence it cannot oblige to <hi>Impoſſibilities.</hi> Again, a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Promiſe by the addition of an Oath is not chang'd into <hi>Poſitive</hi> or <hi>Abſolute;</hi> and to a ſworn Promiſe, as well as to one without an Oath, <hi>Acceptance</hi> from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party is requir'd to make it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
                  <p>BUT the taking of an <hi>Oath</hi> has this <note place="margin">VII. <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </note> Effect among men, for the ſake of that Invocation of God which is therein made uſe of, whoſe Wiſdom no mans Cunning can elude, and who ſuffers not the man that mocks Him to eſcape unpuniſh'd; that not only a <hi>heavier Puniſhment</hi> is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to him who forſwears himſelf, than to him who barely breaks his Word; but it puts them in mind to avoid all <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Prevarication</hi> in the matters about which it is converſant.</p>
                  <p>NOT yet that <hi>all Oaths</hi> are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Strict In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59922:91"/>
does an Oath exclude <hi>tacit Conditions</hi> and <hi>Limitations,</hi> provided they are ſuch as plainly reſult from the Nature of the Thing; as ſuppoſe, I have ſworn to give another whatſoever he ſhall requeſt, if he ask what it is wicked or abſurd for me to grant, I am not at all oblig'd. For he who indefinitely promiſes any thing to him that deſires, before he knows what he is like to ask, preſuppoſes the other will crave nothing but what is honeſt and morally poſſible, not things abſurd or miſchievous to himſelf or any body elſe.</p>
                  <p>THIS is alſo to be noted, that in Oaths <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Senſe of an Oath.</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59922:93"/>
unleſs by Agreement they have procur'd from us ſome ſpecial Right. Although in Communities it does not always happen that Proprieties are kept ſo unmixt and abſolute, but are ſometimes circumſcribed and limited by the Municipal Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or by Orders and Agreements of men among themſelves.

we are oblig'd to <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> when we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>know,</hi> that the Thing does really and truly belong to another.

                  <p>NOW there are various Reaſons why <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Enhaunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing a Price.</hi>
                     </note> the Price of one and the ſame thing ſhould be <hi>encreas'd</hi> or <hi>diminiſh'd,</hi> and why one thing ſhould be preferr'd before another, tho this may ſeem to be of <hi>equal</hi> or <hi>greater <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> to Humane Life. For here the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the thing or its extraordinary <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> is not always regarded; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we ſee thoſe things are of the leaſt account or Value, without which Human Life is leaſt able to ſubſiſt; and therefore not without the ſingular Providence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, <hi>Nature</hi> has been very <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi> in providing <hi>plentiful</hi> ſtore of thoſe things. But the <hi>Rarity</hi> or <hi>Scarceneſs</hi> of Things conduces chiefly to the enhanſing their Value; which is the more look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they are brought from remote Countries. And hence the wanton Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mankind has ſet <hi>extravagant Rates</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59922:103"/>
upon many things, which Humane Life might very well be without, for inſtance upon <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Jewels.</hi> But the Prices of Things, which are of <hi>daily <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> are then chiefly rais'd where the <hi>Scarcity,</hi> is join'd with the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> or <hi>Want</hi> of them. The Prices of <hi>Artificial Things,</hi> beſides their <hi>Scarceneſs,</hi> are for the moſt part enhans'd by their ingenious <hi>Contrivance</hi> and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Art,</hi> that is ſeen in them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Fame and Renown of the Artificer, the Difficulty of the Work, the want of Artiſts in that way, and the like. The Prices of <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> are rais'd by their Difficulty, Neatneſs, Uſefulneſs, Neceſſity, by the Scarcity, Dignity and Ingenuity of the <hi>Authors</hi> of them; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Eſteem and Reputation, which that Art has gotten in the World. The <hi>Contrary</hi> to theſe are wont to <hi>diminiſh</hi> the Price of Things. Sometimes again there may be ſome Certain Thing, which is not generally much eſteem'd, but only by ſome <hi>Particular Perſons,</hi> out of a Peculiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; for Example, becauſe he, from whom we had it, is mightily <hi>belov'd</hi> by us, and that it was given as a <hi>Token</hi> of his Particular Affection to us; or becauſe we have been <hi>accuſtom'd</hi> thereto, or becauſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59922:103"/>
it is a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> of ſome remarkable Accident, or becauſe by the help thereof we have eſcap'd any extraordinary <hi>danger,</hi> or becauſe the Thing was made by <hi>Our ſelves.</hi> And this is called <hi>the Eſtimate of ſingular Affection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT there are other Circumſtances like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">V. <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prices. Legal.</hi>
                     </note> to be conſider'd in <hi>ſtating</hi> the Rates and Prices of <hi>Particular Things.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe indeed, who live in a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Independence on any other, the Prices of Particular Things are determin'd no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, than by the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Perſons Contracting;</hi> ſince they are entirely at their own liberty to make over or to purchaſe what they pleaſe, nor can they be control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their Dealings by any ſuperior Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But in States and Governments the <hi>Prices of Things</hi> are determin'd two ſeveral ways. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is by an <hi>Order</hi> from the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or ſome <hi>Particular Law;</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> is by the Common <hi>Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of Men, or according as the <hi>Market</hi> goes, together with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> of thoſe who Contract among themſelves. The former of theſe by ſome is call'd the <hi>Legal,</hi> the other the <hi>Vulgar Price.</hi> Where the <hi>Legal Rate</hi> is fix'd for the ſake of the <hi>Buyers,</hi> which it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59922:104"/>
is for the moſt part, it is not lawful for the <hi>Sellers</hi> to exact <hi>more;</hi> though they are not forbidden, if they will, to take <hi>leſs.</hi> So where the Rate of any <hi>Labour</hi> or <hi>Work</hi> is tax'd by the Publick Magiſtrate for the ſake of thoſe who have occaſion to Hire, it is not lawful for the Workman to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>more,</hi> though he be not prohibited to take <hi>leſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Price, which is not <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Vulgar Price.</hi>
                     </note> fix'd by the Laws, admits of a Certain <hi>Latitude,</hi> within the Compaſs whereof more or leſs may be and often is either taken or given, according to the <hi>Agreement</hi> of the Perſons <hi>Dealing;</hi> which yet for the moſt part goes according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Market.</hi> Where commonly there is regard had to the Trouble and Charges, which the Tradeſmen generally are at, in the bringing home and managing their Commodities; and alſo after what manner they are bought or ſold, whether by Wholeſale or Retail. Sometimes alſo on a ſudden the Common Price is alter'd by reaſon of the <hi>Plenty</hi> or <hi>Scarcity</hi> of <hi>Buyers, Mony</hi> or the <hi>Commodity.</hi> For the <hi>Scarcity</hi> of Buyers and of Mony, (which on any particular account may happen,) and the plenty of the Commodity may be a means
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59922:104"/>
of <hi>diminiſhing</hi> the Price thereof. On the other hand the Plenty of Buyers and of Money, and the Scarcity of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity <hi>enhanſes</hi> the ſame. Thus as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of a Commodity is leſſened, if it <hi>wants</hi> a Buyer; So the Price is augmented, when the Poſſeſſor is ſolicited to ſell what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he would not have parted with. Laſtly, it is likewiſe to be regarded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Perſon offers <hi>ready Money,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires <hi>Time</hi> for Payment; for allowance of <hi>Time</hi> is part of the <hi>Price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT after Mankind degenerated from <note place="margin">VII. <hi>Price e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent.</hi>
                     </note> their primitive Simplicity, and introduc'd into the World ſeveral kinds of Gaining; it was eaſily diſcern'd that that <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> Price was not ſufficient for the diſpatching the Buſineſs of Men and for the carrying on of Commerce, which then daily encreas'd. For at firſt all kind of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſiſted only in <hi>Exchanging</hi> and <hi>Bartering,</hi> and the Labours of others could no otherwiſe be valued than by Work for Work, or ſome Thing given in hand for Recompence. But after Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deſire ſo many ſeveral things for <hi>Convenience</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> it was not eaſie for every one to become maſter of That which another would be willing to take
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59922:105"/>
in Exchange, or which might be of equal value to the Things he wanted from him. And in Civiliz'd States or Societies, where the Inhabitants are diſtinguiſh'd into <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stations,</hi> there is an abſolute neceſſity there ſhould be different Degrees and Sorts of Men, which, if that ſimple and plain way of <hi>bartering</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> had been ſtill in uſe, could not, or at leaſt not without great difficulty ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hence moſt Nations, which were pleaſed with a more ſumptuous way of living, thought fit by Publick Conſent to ſet an <hi>Eminent Price</hi> or <hi>Value</hi> upon ſome Certain Thing, whereby the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> Prices of other Things ſhould be meaſured, and wherein the ſame ſhould be virtually contained. So that by means of this <hi>Thing</hi> any one may purchaſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whatſoever is to be ſold, and eaſily manage and carry on any kind of Traffick and Bargain.</p>
                  <p>FOR this purpoſe moſt Nations choſe <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> &amp;c.</note> to make uſe of the Nobler kind of <hi>Metals,</hi> and ſuch as were not very Common. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe being of a very compacted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they cannot eaſily be <hi>worn out,</hi> and admit of being <hi>divided</hi> into many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Parts; nor are they leſs proper to be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59922:105"/>
                     <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>handled;</hi> and for the <hi>Rarity</hi> of 'em are equivalent to many other things. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes for Neceſſity, and by ſome Nations for want of <hi>Metals,</hi> other <hi>Things</hi> have been made uſe of inſtead of <hi>Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MOREOVER, in Communities it is <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Coin.</hi>
                     </note> only in the power of the Chief Magiſtrates to aſſign the <hi>Value</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> and thence <hi>Publick Stamps</hi> are wont to be put upon them. Nevertheleſs in the aſſigning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, reſpect is to be had to the Common Eſtimate of the <hi>Neighbouring Nations,</hi> or of thoſe with whom we have any <hi>Traffick</hi> or <hi>Commerce.</hi> For otherwiſe, if the State ſhould ſet too <hi>high a Value</hi> on their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or if they ſhould not give it a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>true Allay,</hi> all Commerce with Forein Nations, which could not be carried on by <hi>Exchange,</hi> or <hi>Barter</hi> alone, would be at a ſtand. And for this very Reaſon the Value of Money is not raſhly to be <hi>alter'd,</hi> unleſs a very great Neceſſity of State require it. Though as Gold and Silver grows more plentiful, the <hi>Value</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Price of Land, and things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending, is wont as it were inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and of it ſelf to grow lower.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of thoſe Contracts in which the Value of Things is preſuppoſed, and of the Duties thence ariſing.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>A <hi>PACT</hi> or <hi>Agreement</hi> in general is <note place="margin">I. <hi>Pacts and Contracts.</hi>
                     </note> the Conſent and Concurrence of Two or more in the ſame <hi>Reſolution.</hi> But becauſe oftentimes ſimple <hi>Agreements</hi> are contradiſtinguiſh'd to <hi>Contracts,</hi> the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſeems chiefly to conſiſt herein, that by <hi>Contracts</hi> are underſtood ſuch Bargains as are made concerning <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> which come within the Compaſs of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> and therefore ſuppoſe a <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> of Things. But ſuch Covenants as are concluded upon, about other Matters, are call'd by the Common Term of <hi>Pacts</hi> or <hi>Agreements.</hi> Although even to ſome of theſe is promiſcuouſly given the Name of <hi>Pacts</hi> and <hi>Contracts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CONTRACTS may be divided into <note place="margin">II. <hi>Contracts of two ſorts.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Gratuitous</hi> and <hi>Chargeable.</hi> The former ſort affords <hi>gratis</hi> ſome Advantage to one of the Parties Contracting, as is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, a Thing Lent, or Depoſited. The
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59922:106"/>
other obliges both Parties reciprocally to the <hi>performance</hi> of ſome certain <hi>Condition.</hi> For in theſe Contracts ſomething is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd or deliver'd with intention, that an <hi>Equivalent</hi> thereto may be receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>NOW all <hi>Chargeable Contracts</hi> naturally <note place="margin">III. <hi>Equality.</hi>
                     </note> imply an <hi>Equality</hi> in 'em, that is, that each of the Perſons Contracting receive of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much in value as himſelf parts with; and if any <hi>Inequality</hi> happens, that Party who receiv'd too little, may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what is wanting to be made up, or elſe he is at liberty wholly to throw up the Contract. And this is chiefly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in Governments and Societies, where the Prices of Things are aſcertain'd either by Law or the Cuſtom of the Market. But for the better ſtating and determining this Equality, it is requiſite, that the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Parties do well underſtand the Thing about which they are driving a bargain, with all thoſe of its Qualifications and Circumſtances that are of any Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And hence it is, that He who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to transfer any Thing to another by Contract, ought to lay before him not only the Good Qualities of the Thing, but alſo its Faults and Defects. For without this a <hi>Juſt Price</hi> cannot be put upon it.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59922:107"/>
Not that 'tis neceſſary to declare ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as no ways affect the Thing it ſelf; nor is there any occaſion to take notice of Faults which are already known on <hi>both ſides.</hi> For he that <hi>wittingly</hi> buys any Thing that is amiſs, muſt take the blame upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>NOW in theſe Contracts an <hi>Equality</hi> is <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Defects to be made good.</hi>
                     </note> ſo far to be regarded, that although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all was conceal'd or diſſembled; yet if afterwards any Inequality be found out, even though neither of the Parties Contracting were blameworthy, either for that the Defect lay altogether hid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd, or that there was ſome miſtake in the Price, ſuch like things muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifi'd, and he who has too much, muſt allow to him that wanted to make the Bargain good. Although for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a multitude of unneceſſary Suits, the Laws of every Country have here chiefly made Proviſion againſt the moſt <hi>Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abuſes;</hi> as to the Reſt, ſuppoſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will be careful in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
                  <p>GRATUITOUS Contracts are chiefly <note place="margin">V. <hi>Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi>
                     </note> Three, a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> a Thing <hi>Lent,</hi> and a <hi>Depoſit</hi> or Truſt. A Commiſſion is, when any one ſhall undertake <hi>Gratis</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59922:107"/>
and Diſpatch of Anothers buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at his Deſire and Requeſt. And this happens two ſeveral ways, either when the Method of managing it is <hi>preſcrib'd</hi> to him, or when it is <hi>left</hi> to his <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> In this Caſe as Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and great Diligence is required, ſince no Body almoſt will give a Commiſſion but to a Friend, and one of whom he has a very good Opinion; ſo on the other Hand the Truſtee ought to be indempnified from the Expences he is at upon the Thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Care; and alſo from the Loſſes he may incur by reaſon thereof, and which properly proceeded from the Commiſſion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>A Thing <hi>Lent</hi> is, when we grant <hi>gratis</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Thing lent.</hi>
                     </note> the Uſe of what is our own, to another. Wherein 'tis to be obſerv'd, that every one ſhould carefully and diligently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and look after the Thing entruſted; not convert the ſame to other Uſes, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Perſon Lending does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and to reſtore the ſame entire and in the ſame Condition as he receiv'd it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing only for what detriment it muſt of neceſſity receive by the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſe thereof. But if any Thing be granted for a <hi>Certain time,</hi> and in the mean
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59922:108"/>
while the Owner be in great want of it, by reaſon of ſome accident which was not foreſeen at the time of the Lending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſame muſt be reſtor'd whenever he demands it, without any ſhuffling or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. But if the Thing Lent <hi>periſhes</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly or by any Accident, without any neglect of the Perſon to whom it was lent, the Value thereof is not to be made good, if the ſame in all Probability would have likewiſe periſhed in the Cuſtody of the Right Owner. Otherwiſe it is but Equity that the Perſon to whom it was lent ſhould pay the Price of it, becauſe the Right Owner would not have loſt it, had he not been ſo kind to Another. On the other hand if the <hi>perſon borrowing</hi> have been at any <hi>neceſſary Expence</hi> upon the Thing Lent beſides that, which by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence attends the Uſe of it, the ſame ought to be refunded by the Owner thereof.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Depoſit</hi> or <hi>Thing left</hi> is, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">VII. <hi>A Depoſit.</hi>
                     </note> any thing of our own, or any ways belonging to us, to the Truſt of another Perſon, to keep the ſame <hi>Gratis.</hi> In which Caſe 'tis requiſite, that the Thing ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted ſhould be carefully look'd after, and reſtor'd to the Deponent, whenever
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59922:108"/>
he pleaſes to call for it; unleſs ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution would be prejudicial both to the Owner and to Others, and upon that ſcore it may be deferr'd. Nor is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the Thing ſo depoſited, without the Conſent of the Owner, if it can any ways receive <hi>Damage</hi> by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> or it be for the Intereſt of the Owner, that it ſhould not be ſeen. And if any one ſhall preſume to do it, he ſhall make good whatſoever <hi>Damages</hi> it may have ſuſtain'd by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Neither is it Lawful to take the Thing depoſited out of thoſe Covers and Receptacles, wherein it was wrap'd up and incloſed by the Perſon who left it. But as it is very baſe and even more heinous than Theft it ſelf to deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivery of any thing that was left to our Truſt; ſo it is yet much more deteſtable for any one to diſown a <hi>Miſerable Depoſit,</hi> that is, what was left with him by reaſon of any Misfortune, in Danger of Fire, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion or Tumult. Again, the Deponent is to refund the <hi>Charges</hi> that have been laid out upon the Thing Depoſited.</p>
                  <p>NOW among <hi>chargeable Contracts,</hi> or <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Barter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </note> Covenants which imply ſomewhat to be done or given on both parts, the moſt Ancient, and that whereby Trading and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59922:109"/>
Commerce was carried on before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Money, was <hi>Permutation</hi> or <hi>Bartering,</hi> whereby on each ſide ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was given for ſome other thing equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent thereto. Altho at this day, ſince the Invention of Money, that ſort of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> is chiefly practis'd among Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whereby things are not ſimply compar'd between themſelves, but they are firſt reduc'd to Money, and afterwards deliver'd as ſo much Money. But <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Donation</hi> is a different ſort of a Thing from the Contract of Barter, for in this there is no neceſſity that an <hi>Equality</hi> ſhould be obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>BUYING and <hi>Selling</hi> is, when for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Buying and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                     </note> the Property of any thing is acquired, or elſe ſuch a Right as is equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, of which kind this is the moſt plain and obvious, when the Buyer, after the Value is agreed upon, immediately pays down the Price, and the Seller thereupon delivers the Commodity. Yet oftentimes the Agreement is made ſo, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity ſhould be immediately deliver'd, and the Price thereof paid at a Certain Time. And ſometimes the Price is agreed upon, but the Delivery of the Thing or Commodity is to be within a Certain
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59922:109"/>
Time Limited. In which Caſe it ſeems but Equity, that before the Time be elaps'd, the Seller ſhould ſtand to the hazard of it; but if after the Time is elaps'd, the Buyer makes delay and neglects the taking it away, then, if the Commodity periſhes, the Buyer ſhall ſtand wholly to the loſs thereof. Now to this of Buying and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling are wont to be added ſeveral other kinds of Bargains. As that, which is term'd <hi>Addictio in diem,</hi> whereby any Thing is ſold with this Proviſo, that it may be lawful for the Seller to accept of better Terms, offered by another within a Certain Time. So alſo the <hi>Lex Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſoria,</hi> which is ſuch a Condition in any Contract, as, not being perform'd within a Time Limited, the Bargain becomes void. So likewiſe any kind of Recalling, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of recanting a Bargain, which is to be either ſo underſtood, that if the Price be laid down within a certain Time limited, or at any time whatever is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, the Buyer ſhall be oblig'd to reſtore it again to the Seller; or elſe ſo, as if the Thing be offer'd again, the Seller is bound to return back again the Price thereof; or ſo as, if the Buyer be willing to ſell the ſame again, the Firſt Seller ſhould
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59922:110"/>
have the Refuſal of it, before any other, which is likewiſe call'd <hi>Jus protimiſeos</hi> or the Right of Pre-emption. It is alſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary that the Seller ſhould reſerve to himſelf a Certain Portion of the Lands which he ſells, or ſome Uſe or Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for the ſame. There is another way of Buying, which they call <hi>per aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem,</hi> when ſeveral Things of different Prices are not valued ſingly, but at hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazard, and, as it were, in the lump. In that way of Sale, which is call'd an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> the Thing is adjudg'd to that Perſon, who, among ſeveral Bidders, offers moſt. Laſtly, there is another way of Buying, whereby not any Certain Thing is bought, but only the Probable Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; which implies ſomething of <hi>Chance;</hi> ſo as, neither the Buyer, if his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation fails him, nor the Seller, tho it much exceed, have any Reaſon to complain.</p>
                  <p>HIRING and <hi>Letting</hi> is when the <note place="margin">X. <hi>Hiring and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
                     </note> Uſe of a Thing, or any Labour is granted to another, upon a Certain Conſideration. Wherein, although regularly the Price is for the moſt part agreed upon before hand; yet if any one without making a Bargain makes over his Labour or the Uſe of any Thing belonging to him, he is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59922:110"/>
to expect ſo much as the Common Cuſtom, or the Honeſty and Equity of the Perſon Hiring will allow. Concerning this kind of Contract, 'tis to be obſerv'd, that if the Thing let out happens wholly to periſh, from that time the Perſon Hiring is no longer oblig'd to pay the Wages or Penſion agreed upon. But if the Thing hir'd has any Certain and Determin'd Uſe, ſo as the Owner is oblig'd to make it fit and ſerviceable for that purpoſe; in this Caſe if it receives any Prejudice, that Perſon who hires it may deduct ſo much of the Hire, as the Thing is decay'd as to its Uſe. But if the Profit or Increaſe of the Thing farmed out be uncertain, and have any thing of Chance attending it, as a large Increaſe happens to the Advantage of the Hirer, ſo a ſmall one is to his Loſs; nor can there be any Thing deducted from the Penſion in ſtrictneſs of Law, upon the Account of Barrenneſs; eſpecially ſince a Dearth of one Year may be recompenc'd by the Plenty of another. Unleſs thoſe Accidents, which prevent the Increaſe, do but very rarely happen, and the Perſon Hiring be preſum'd not to have any ways imagin'd the taking ſuch a Chance upon himſelf. For it is but equitable that ſuch
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59922:111"/>
like Accidents ſhould contribute to the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of the Penſion. But as he who lets out any Thing to another, is oblig'd to make the Thing fit for Uſe, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the Neceſſary Charges; ſo the Perſon Hiring muſt be a Good Husband in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Thing, and muſt make good what was loſt through his Neglect. And he who has hir'd any Work to be done, which by his own fault was ſpoil'd, muſt do the like. He that has agreed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for any Service of his, which he is to do preſently, if he be hindred by any Accident from performing the ſame, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demand any Reward. But he who has hir'd any one for ſome conſiderable Time, if he happens to be render'd unfit for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for a ſhort time by Sickneſs or any other Accident, it is inhuman to turn him out of his Buſineſs or to deduct any thing out of his Wages.</p>
                  <p>IN a Contract of <hi>Things Lent,</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">XI. <hi>Things lent.</hi>

                     <hi>Specie;</hi> becauſe any Thing of that kind may ſo perform the Part of another thing, that he who receives any thing of that <hi>Kind</hi> in the ſame <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> may be ſaid to have receiv'd the <hi>ſame,</hi> which he gave. The ſame Things are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determin'd and ſpecified by Number, Weight and Meaſure, in which reſpect alſo they are commonly call'd <hi>Quantities,</hi> as they are contradiſtinct to <hi>Species.</hi> Now a Thing is lent either <hi>gratis,</hi> ſo as no more is to be receiv'd than was deliver'd; or elſe for ſome Profit or Advantage, which is call'd <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury;</hi> and which is no ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Law of Nature, provided it be moderate, and proportionable to the Gain, which the other Perſon makes of the Mony or the Thing Lent; and which had it not been put out, would have been neither Loſs nor Gain; and that it be not exacted of <hi>Poor Men,</hi> to whom a Thing Lent is ſometimes as good as an <hi>Alms.</hi>

                  <p>IN a Contract of <hi>Partnerſhip</hi> Two or <note place="margin">XII. <hi>Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
                     </note> More join together their <hi>Money, Wares,</hi> or <hi>Works</hi> with an Intention that every one ſhould receive a proportionable ſhare of the Profit; and if there happens to be any Loſs, that likewiſe muſt be born ratably by each Party. In which kind of Society
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59922:112"/>
as all Parties are oblig'd to Faithfulneſs and Induſtry; ſo no Party muſt break off the Partnerſhip before the Time, or to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of his Partner. But when the time of the Partnerſhip is expired, after the Gain and Loſs is allowed, each Party is to receive what Stock he put in. But if one Perſon puts in <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Goods,</hi> and the other contributes his <hi>Labour,</hi> we muſt conſider, after what manner ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution was made. For when one mans <hi>Labour</hi> is only concern'd about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and diſpoſing of the other Perſons <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Goods,</hi> the Shares of the Gain are ſo to be determin'd, as the Profit of the <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Commodity</hi> bears Proportion to the Value of the <hi>Labour;</hi> the <hi>Principal</hi> ſtill remaining the Property of him only who firſt contributed it. But when any Labour is beſtow'd in the <hi>Improvement</hi> of any Commodity which is put in by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is ſuppos'd to have ſuch a Share in the Thing it ſelf as is Proportionable to the <hi>Improvement</hi> it has receiv'd. Again, when men engage all that they have in any Joint-Stock, as each of the Partners muſt faithfully bring into the Account the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they have made; ſo alſo every one of them is to be maintain'd out of the Joint-Stock
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59922:112"/>
according to their Condition. But when the Partnerſhip is broken off, the Diviſion of the Goods is made ratably according as each Party at firſt brought in; without any Regard had, by whoſe Goods any Gain or Loſs hapned to the Company, unleſs beforehand it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agreed.</p>
                  <p>THERE are likewiſe ſeveral Contracts, <note place="margin">XIII. <hi>Contracts upon Chance.</hi>
                     </note> which imply a <hi>Chance:</hi> amongſt which may be reckon'd <hi>Wagers,</hi> when the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of any Event, which is not yet known by either Party, is affirmed by one and denied by the other, a Certain Value being laid on both ſides, which is adjudg'd to that Perſon, to whoſe Aſſertion the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is found to agree. Hitherto may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be referr'd all ſorts of <hi>Games,</hi> wherein we play for any thing of Value. Among which thoſe have the leaſt Chance, which contain a Trial of <hi>Wit, Dexterity, Skill</hi> or <hi>Strength.</hi> In ſome of theſe <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> have both a like ſhare. In others <hi>Chance</hi> does chiefly determin the matter. Altho it is the Part of the Civil Magiſtrate to conſider how far ſuch kind of Contracts may be tolerated, as conſiſtent with the Publick or Private Good: Among theſe we may reckon the various ſorts of <hi>Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries;</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:59922:113"/>
as either when ſeveral men having paid for a Thing by Money laid down jointly, refer it to a deciſion by Lot, which of them ſhall have the Whole: or when a Box or Pot of Lots is made uſe of, into which a Certain Number of Lots or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, both Blanks and Prizes are put, and for ſome ſet Price, Liberty is granted of drawing them out, ſo that the Perſon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may receive the Prize mark'd upon the Lot. To theſe Contracts the receiv'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of <hi>Inſurance</hi> have ſome kind of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, which are ſuch Bargains whereby is undertaken the ſecuring from and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good any Damage, ſo that the Inſurer, for a certain Sum of Mony paid down, takes upon himſelf and is oblig'd to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for whatſoever Loſſes or Damages any Commodities may undergo in their tranſportation to remote Countries; ſo that if it ſhall happen that they be loſt, he is bound to pay the Owner the Value of them.</p>
                  <p>FOR the rendring of Contracts and <note place="margin">XIV. <hi>Sureties and Pledges.</hi>
                     </note> Covenants more firm and ſecure, <hi>Sureties</hi> and <hi>Pledges</hi> are frequently made uſe of. A <hi>Surety</hi> is, when another Perſon, who is approv'd of by the Creditor, takes upon himſelf the Obligation of the Principal
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59922:113"/>
Debtor, ſo that unleſs he makes payment, the other muſt make it good; Yet ſo, that the Principal Debtor is oblig'd to repay him and ſave him harmleſs. And although the Surety cannot ſtand bound for a Greater Sum, than the Principal Debtor, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders but that the Surety is more firmly ty'd than the other, becauſe more is rely'd upon his Credit than upon that of the Principal Debtor. Yet in courſe the Principal Debtor is to be call'd upon before the Surety, unleſs he has wholly taken the Obligation upon himſelf; and ſuch a Perſon in the Civil Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd <hi>Expromiſſor,</hi> or an Undertaker. Now if ſeveral Perſons be Security for one, each of them is to be call'd upon for his Proportion only; unleſs by Accident any one of them becomes Inſolvent, or is not to be found. For in ſuch a Caſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers muſt be charg'd with his Share.</p>
                  <p>'TIS likewiſe oftentimes cuſtomary for <note place="margin">XV. <hi>Pledge or Mortgage.</hi>
                     </note> the Debtor to deliver or make over to the Creditor for ſecuring his Debt, ſome certain Thing, which is call'd a <hi>Pledge</hi> or a <hi>Mortgage,</hi> until the Debt be paid. The Intent of which is not only that the Debtor ſhould be excited to make payment out of a deſire of recovering what belongs to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59922:114"/>
him; but alſo that the Creditor ſhould have ſome Proſpect, how he may be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And upon this account Pledges ought regularly to be of equal, or greater Value than the Debt it ſelf. Now the Things which may be offer'd as Pledges, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Improveable, or not Improveable; as to the former kind there is commonly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Covenant call'd <hi>Pactum</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which impowers the Creditor to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Fruits and Profits of that Pledge, inſtead of <hi>Intereſt;</hi> Now as to the other ſort the <hi>Lex Commiſſoria</hi> takes Place; which provides that the Pledge ſhall be forfeited to the Creditor, if Payment be not made within a Certain time Limited: And this is no ways unreaſonable, when the Pledge is not of greater Value than the Debt, together with the Uſe for the intermediate Time, and provided the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus be reſtored to the Owner. But as the Creditor is oblig'd to reſtore the Pledge upon payment of the Debt; ſo in the mean time he ought to be as careful in the preſerving thereof, as if it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his own. And when there is no <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the thing be of that nature, as to receive any damage by Uſe, or if it be any ways for the Debtor's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59922:114"/>
he ought not to make uſe of it without his Conſent. Now a <hi>Mortgage</hi> differs from a <hi>Pledge</hi> in this, that a Pledge conſiſts in the Delivery of the Thing, but a <hi>Mortgage,</hi> tho the Thing be not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, holds good by the bare Aſſignation of a Thing altogether Immoveable, from which, Payment not being made, the Creditor may receive ſatisfaction for his Debt.</p>
                  <p>AND thus what the Duties of Perſons <note place="margin">XVI.</note> contracting are, will plainly appear from the End and Nature of theſe Contracts.</p>

of what was agreed upon.

Yet with this Proviſo, that he who pays for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any Intention of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon him, he may demand from the ſame again what he laid out upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Moreover, Payment muſt be made to that Perſon to whom it is due, or elſe to one whom he has <hi>appointed</hi> to receive the Debt in his Name. And laſtly, <hi>that very Thing</hi> muſt be perform'd or paid, which was agreed upon; not any Thing elſe inſtead thereof, intire and not imperfect, not only in parcels or by piece-meal; and likewiſe at the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> appointed. Altho frequently the <hi>Courteſie</hi> of the Creditor or the <hi>Inability</hi> of the Debtor may be the occaſion of prolonging the time of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of receiving a Debt by little Sums at once, or elſe of accepting of one Thing for another.</p>
                  <p>OBLIGATIONS are likewiſe taken <note place="margin">II. <hi>Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59922:115"/>
Debt, one againſt the other, or when the Debtor is therefore diſcharg'd, becauſe 'tis manifeſt that the Creditor himſelf ſtands indebted to him for ſomething that is of the ſame kind, and of the ſame Value. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince in thoſe <hi>Things</hi> (call'd <hi>res fungibiles,</hi> that is) which admit of being repaid in <hi>kind</hi> tho not in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent is look'd upon to be the ſame Thing; and where the Debt is Mutual, ſince I muſt preſently return back as much as I have receiv'd; for the declining of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Payments, it ſeems to be the moſt convenient way ſo to order the matter that each Party may keep what he has. Now it is evident that thoſe Things aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd may very properly be brought to a Balance, of which the time for Payment is either preſent, or paſt. But it is not ſo in other Things or Performances which are of a Different Nature; unleſs they are eſtimated on both ſides and reduc'd to Mony.</p>

as are apparent to the Senſes; hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one in <hi>foro humano</hi> is adjudg'd to be <hi>obliged to that Thing, which he may fairly be ſuppoſed to have ſuggeſted by a Right Interpretation of the outward Signs made by him.</hi> Wherefore 'tis of great Uſe for the true Underſtanding both of Laws and Covenants, and for the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Duties thence ariſing, that there ſhould be laid down <hi>Certain Rules for the true Interpretation of Words</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, they being the moſt common and ordinary Signs whereby we expreſs our Mind and Intention.</p>
                  <p>CONCERNING <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Terms</hi> this is the Rule: Words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be taken in their moſt Proper and receiv'd Signification, which they have not ſo much from Analogy and Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Grammar, or Conformity of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, as by Popular <hi>

                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59922:118"/>
BUT for diſcovering the genuine mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</hi>
                     </note> of Words 'tis ſometimes neceſſary to make uſe of <hi>Conjectures,</hi> if either the Words in themſelves or the Connection of them be Ambiguous and liable to a double In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; or if ſome Parts of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſeem to contradict the other, yet ſo as by a fair and true Explanation they may be <hi>reconcil'd.</hi> For where there is a plain and manifeſt Contrariety the latter part muſt be accounted to <hi>contradict</hi> that which went before.</p>
                  <p>NOW Conjectures of the Mind, and <note place="margin">V. <hi>Taken from the Subject-Matter.</hi>
                     </note> the Right meaning thereof in an Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or Intricate Expreſſion are chiefly to be taken <hi>from the Subject Matter, from the Effects and the Accidents</hi> or Circumſtances As to the <hi>Matter</hi> this is the Rule: Words are generally to be underſtood according to the Subject Matter. For he that ſpeaks is ſuppos'd to have always in view the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which he diſcourſes, and therefore agreeable thereunto the meaning of the Words is always to be applied.</p>
                  <p>AS to the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> this <note place="margin">VI. <hi>From the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</hi>
                     </note> is the Rule: When Words taken in the Literal and Simple Senſe admit either o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> may be taken from the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;</hi> becauſe of Conſequence every one is preſum'd to be conſiſtent with himſelf. Now theſe Circumſtances are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd either as to their <hi>Place,</hi> or only as to the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of them. Concerning the <hi>Former</hi> of theſe this is the Rule: If the Senſe in any Place of the Diſcourſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd plainly and clearly, the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Phraſes are to be interpreted by thoſe plain and familiar ones. To this Rule there is another nearly related: In the explaining of any Diſcourſe the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents and Conſequents muſt be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heeded, to which thoſe Things that are inſerted between are preſum'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and agree. But concerning the <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> this is the Rule: The <hi>obſcure</hi> Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of one and the ſame Man are to be interpreted by what he has deliver'd more clearly, tho it was at another Time and Place; unleſs it manifeſtly appears that he has chang'd his Opinion.</p>
                  <p>IT is likewiſe of very great Uſe for <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Thing.</hi>
                     </note> finding out the true Meaning, in Laws e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, to examine into the <hi>Reaſon of</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59922:119"/>
                     <hi>that Law,</hi> or thoſe Cauſes and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which induced the Legiſlator to the making thereof; and moreparticularly when it is evident, that that was the <hi>only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the Law. Concerning which this is the Rule: That Interpretation of the Law is to be followed, which agrees with the Reaſon of that Law; and the contrary is to be rejected, if it be altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſame. So likewiſe when the Sole and Adequate Reaſon of the Law ceaſes, the Law it ſelf ceaſes. But when there are ſeveral Reaſons of the ſame Law, it does not follow that if one of them ceaſes, the whole Law ceaſes too, when there are more Reaſons remaining, which are ſufficient for the keeping it ſtill in Force. Sometimes alſo the Will of the Lawgiver is ſufficient, where the Reaſon of the Law is conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>MOREOVER, it is to be obſerv'd that <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Words of various ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </note> many Words have <hi>various Significations,</hi> one meaning being of great Latitude and the other more <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>confin'd;</hi> and then the Subject Matter is ſometimes of a <hi>favourable</hi> Nature, ſometimes <hi>invidious,</hi> ſometimes between both or <hi>Indifferent.</hi> Thoſe are <hi>favourable</hi> where the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Equal on both ſides, where regard
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59922:119"/>
is had to the Publick Good, where provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made upon Tranſactions already ratified, and which tends to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Peace, and the like. The <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious</hi> or moſt diſtaſtful is that which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieves one Party only or one more than the other, that which implies a certain Penalty, that which makes any Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of none effect or alters what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that which promotes Wars and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. That which is between both and <hi>Indifferent</hi> is, That indeed which makes ſome Change and Alteration in the former State of things, but 'tis only for the ſake of Peace. Concerning theſe, this is the Rule: That thoſe Things which admit of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable</hi> Conſtruction are to be taken in the largeſt and moſt comprehenſive mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but thoſe things which are capable of an unpleaſing Conſtruction in the moſt Literal and ſtricteſt ſenſe of the Words.</p>
                  <p>THERE are likewiſe ſome kind of <note place="margin">X. <hi>Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi>
                     </note> Conjectures which are elſewhere to be fetch'd than from the Words, and which are the occaſion that the Interpretation of them is ſometimes to be <hi>extended,</hi> and at other times to be <hi>confin'd.</hi> Although 'tis more eaſie to give Reaſons why the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation thereof ſhould be <hi>confin'd</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59922:120"/>
than <hi>extended.</hi> But the Law may be <hi>extended</hi> to a Caſe, which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the Law, if it be apparent, that the Reaſon which ſuits to this Caſe, was particularly regarded by the Lawgiver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Conſiderations, and that he did deſign to include the other Caſes of the like Nature. The Law alſo ought to be <hi>extended</hi> to thoſe Caſes, wherein the ſubtilty of Ill men have found out tricks in order to evade the force of the Law.</p>
                  <p>NOW the Reaſon why ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <note place="margin">XI. <hi>Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.</hi>
                     </note> deliver'd in General Terms ſhould be <hi>reſtrain'd,</hi> may happen either from the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Defect of the Will</hi> or from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy of ſome <hi>Emergent Caſe</hi> to the Will and Intention. That any Perſon is to be preſum'd not at firſt to have intended any ſuch thing, may be underſtood, 1. From the <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> which otherwiſe would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from thence; and which, 'tis believ'd, no man in his wits could deſign. Hence General Expreſſions are to be reſtrain'd, inaſmuch as ſuch Abſurdity would thence otherwiſe ariſe. 2. From <hi>Want of that Reaſon</hi> which might chiefly cauſe him to be of that mind. Hence in a General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion thoſe Caſes are not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which do no ways agree with the Sole
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59922:120"/>
and Adequate Reaſon of the Law. 3. From <hi>Defect of Matter,</hi> which always he that ſpeaks is ſuppos'd to have conſider'd. And therefore all thoſe General Words are to be regarded with relation to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>NOW that an emergent State of Things <note place="margin">XII. <hi>Emergent Caſes.</hi>
                     </note> is repugnant to the Intention of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who made the Conſtitution, may be diſcover'd either from <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> or elſe from ſome declared mark and <hi>Signification</hi> of his Meaning. The Firſt happens, when we muſt exclude <hi>Equity,</hi> if ſome certain Caſes be not exempted from the Univerſal Law. For <hi>Equity</hi> is the Correcting of what is defective in the Law by reaſon of its <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality.</hi> And becauſe all Caſes could neither be foreſeen, nor ſet down, becauſe of the infinite variety of them; therefore when General Words are apply'd to ſpecial Caſes, thoſe Caſes are to be look'd upon as Exempt, which the Lawgiver himſelf would likewiſe have exempted, if he had been conſulted upon ſuch a Caſe. But we muſt not have recourſe to <hi>Equity,</hi> unleſs there be very ſufficient Grounds for it. The Chiefeſt of which is, if it be evident, that the Law of Nature would be violated, if we follow too cloſely the Letter of that Law. The next Ground of Exception is;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59922:121"/>
that tho it be not indeed unlawful to keep to the very words of the Law; yet, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an impartial conſideration the Thing ſhould ſeem too grievous and burdenſom, either to Men in General, or to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons; or elſe if the Deſign be not of that Value, as to be purchas'd at ſo dear a Rate.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, AN Exception is to be made <note place="margin">XIII. <hi>Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with regard to Time.</hi>
                     </note> from a General Expreſſion, if Words put in another Place, are not indeed directly oppoſite to the preſent Law o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Agreement, but by reaſon of ſome Circumſtance in Time <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> cannot be obſerv'd all at once. Here therefore ſome certain Rules are to be taken notice of, in order to underſtand what Law in that Caſe, when both cannot be obſerved at the ſame Time, is to be prefer'd. 1. That which is only <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> is to give place to what is <hi>enjoin'd.</hi> 2. What muſt be done at ſome <hi>certain</hi> Time, is to be prefer'd to that which may be done at <hi>any</hi> time. 3. An <hi>Affirmative</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept gives place to the <hi>Negative;</hi> or when the Affirmative Precept cannot be obſerv'd, without the Violation of the Negative, the Performance of the former is to be omitted for the preſent. 4. Among Agreements and Laws which are otherwiſe of equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59922:121"/>
a <hi>Particular</hi> is to be prefer'd before a <hi>General</hi> one. 5. Of two Covenants made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one and the ſame Time, whereof the One is founded upon more <hi>honourable,</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> Reaſons than the other, it is but equal that the Former ſhould take place of the Latter. 6. A Covenant or Contract that is confirm'd by an <hi>Oath,</hi> takes place of one which is not ſo, when both cannot be obſerv'd at the ſame time. 7. An <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> Obligation gives place to that which is <hi>perfect.</hi> 8. The Duty of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> all circumſtances rightly compared, gives place to the Duty of <hi>Gratitude.</hi>

                     </note> in the <hi>firſt</hi> mention'd way, is that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein he is plac'd by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor purſuant to his Divine Will, that he ſhould be the moſt excellent Animal in the whole Creation. From the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which <hi>State</hi> it follows, that Man ought to acknowledge the Author of his Being, to pay him Adoration, and to admire the Works of his hands; and moreover to lead his Life after a different manner from that of the Brutes.

                  </p>
                  <p>IN the <hi>ſecond</hi> way we may contemplate <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Second.</hi>
                     </note> the Natural <hi>State</hi> of Man, by ſeriouſly forming in our minds an Idea of what his

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Natural State</hi> may be conſider'd, either as it is repreſented to us <hi>Notionally</hi> and by way of <hi>Fiction,</hi> or as it is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> is done, when we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a certain Multitude of men at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to have ſtarted up into beings all at once without any dependence upon one another, as it is fabled of the <hi>Cadmean</hi> Harveſt of Brethren; or elſe when we form a Suppoſition, that all the mutual Ties by which Mankind are one way or other united together were now diſſolv'd, ſo that every man might ſet up for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the reſt, and no one man ſhould have any other Relation to his Fellow, but the likeneſs of their Natures. But the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59922:124"/>
true State of Nature, or that which is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> ſo, has this in it, that there is no man who has not ſome peculiar Obligations to <hi>ſome</hi> other men, though with all the reſt he may have no farther Alliance than that they are Men and of the ſame Kind, and beſide what ariſes from thence he ows them no Service at all. Which at this time is the Caſe of many Kingdoms and Communities, and of the Subjects of the ſame with reſpect to the Subjects of the other; and the ſame was antiently the State of the Patriarchs when they liv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently.</p>
                  <p>IT is then taken for manifeſt, that all <note place="margin">VII. <hi>Paternal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                     </note> Mankind never were univerſally and at once in the former <hi>Natural State;</hi> for thoſe Children who were begotten and born of the Protoplaſts, or firſt created Man and Woman, (from whom the whole Human Race derives its Original, as the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures tell us) were ſubject to the <hi>Paternal Authority.</hi> Not but that this Natural State aroſe afterwards among ſome People: for Men at firſt, in order to ſpread over this wide World, and that they might find for themſelves and their Cattel more ſpacious Abodes, left the Families of their Fathers, and roaming into various Regions, almoſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59922:125"/>
every ſingle man became himſelf the Father of a Family of his own; and the Poſterity of theſe again diſperſing themſelves, that <hi>peculiar Bond</hi> of Kindred and the Natural Affections thence ariſing by little and little were extinct, and no other Obligation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, but that common one, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from the Likeneſs of their Natures. Till afterwards when Mankind was vaſtly multiplied, they having obſerv'd the many Inconveniencies of that looſe way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the Inhabitants of places near one another by degrees join'd in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which at firſt were ſmall, but grew ſoon greater, either by the voluntary or forc'd Conjunction of many which were leſſer. And among theſe Communities the State of Nature is ſtill found, they being not otherwiſe oblig'd to each other, than by the common Tie of Humanity.</p>
                  <p>NOW it is the chief <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Natural Liberty.</hi>
                     </note> thoſe who are in the State of Nature, that they are ſubject and accountable to none but God only; in which reſpect alſo this is called a State of <hi>Natural Liberty,</hi> by which is underſtood, that a Perſon ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanc'd without ſome antecedent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Act to the contrary, is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely in his own power and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59922:125"/>
and above the controll of all mortal Authority. Therefore alſo any one perſon is to be reputed <hi>equal</hi> to any other, to whom himſelf is not ſubject, neither is that other ſubject to him. And furthermore whereas Man is indued with the Light of Reaſon, by the guidance whereof he may tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and regulate his Actions, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that whoſoever lives in a State of Natural Liberty, depends not on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the direction of his doings; but is veſted with a Right to do according to his own Judgment and Will any thing he ſhall think good, and which is conſonant to found Reaſon. And whereas Man, from that univerſal Inclination which is implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Living Creatures, cannot but (in order to the Preſervation of his Perſon and his Life, and to the keeping off what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Miſchiefs ſeem to threaten the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof) take the utmoſt care and pains, and apply all neceſſary means to that end; and yet whereas no man in this Natural State has any ſuperiour perſon, to whom he may ſubmit his Deſigns and Opinions, therefore every one in this State makes uſe of his own Judgment only in determining concerning the Fitneſs of Means, whether they conduce to his Self-Preſervation
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59922:126"/>
or not. For tho he may give ear to the Advice of another, yet it is in his choice whether he will approve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſame. But that this abſolute Power of governing himſelf be rightly manag'd, it is highly neceſſary, that all his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations be moderated by the Dictates of true Reaſon and by the Rules of the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>AND yet this Natural State, how al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
                     </note> ſoever it appears to us with the Name of Liberty, and flattering us with being free from all manner of Subjection; yet was it clog'd, before men join'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Governments, with many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences;</hi> whether we ſuppoſe every ſingle man as in that Condition, or only conſider the Caſe of the Patriarchs or Fathers of Families, while they lived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent. For if you form in your mind the Idea of a Man even at his full growth of Strength and Underſtanding, but without all thoſe Aſſiſtances and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by which the Wit of man has rendred Human Life much more orderly and more eaſie than at the beginning; you ſhall have before you, a naked Creature, no better than dumb, wanting all things, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying his Hunger with Roots and Herbs,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59922:126"/>
ſlaking his Thirſt with any Water he can find, avoiding the extremities of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by creeping into Caves or the like, expoſed an eaſie prey to the ravenous Beaſts, and trembling at the ſight of any of them. 'Tis true, the way of Living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Patriarchs might be ſomewhat more comfortable even while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their Families apart; but yet it could by no means be compar'd with the Life of men in a Community, not ſo much for the Need they might have of things from abroad, which, if they reſtrain'd their Appetites, they might perhaps well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough bear withal; as becauſe in that State they could have little Certainty of any continued Security. And that we may comprehend all in a few words, in a State of Nature every man muſt rely upon his own ſingle Power, whereas in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity all are on his ſide; there no man can be ſure of enjoying the Fruit of his Labour, here every one has it ſecur'd to him; There the Paſſions rule, and there is a continual Warfare accompanied with Fears, Want, Sordidneſs, Solitude, Barbarity, Ignorance and Brutiſhneſs; here Reaſon governs, and here is Tranquillity, Security, Wealth, Neatneſs, Society, Elegancy, Knowledg and Humanity.</p>

And here becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allows not that upon every occaſion we ſhould be take our ſelves to <hi>violent means,</hi> even though we are very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in our Conſciences of the Juſtice of our Cauſe; therefore we are firſt to try, whether the matter may not be compoſed after a milder way, either by an amicable reaſoning of the point in queſtion between the parties themſelves, or by a free and unconditional Compromiſe, or <hi>Reference</hi> of the Debate to <hi>Arbitrators.</hi> And theſe Referees are to manage the matter with an equal regard to both ſides, and in giving their Award they are to have an Eye only to the Merits of the Cauſe, ſetting aſide all partial Animoſity or Affection. For which reaſon it is not beſt to chuſe any man an Arbitrator in ſuch a Cauſe, wherein
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59922:127"/>
he ſhall have greater hopes of Profit or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reputation, if one party get the better rather than the other; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently where it is his Intereſt that that Litigant at what rate ſoever gain the point. Hence alſo there ought not to be any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand Bargain or Promiſe between the Umpire and either of the Parties by which he may be obliged to give his Judgment on the behalf of the ſame. Now in this affair, if the Arbitrator cannot find out the Truth in Fact neither from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the parties, nor from apparent Writings nor any other manifeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Signs; he muſt then inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Teſtimonies of Witneſſes, whom though the Law of Nature obliges, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being uſually reinforc'd by the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of an Oath, to ſpeak the Truth, yet it is moſt ſafe not to admit the Evidence of ſuch as are ſo peculiarly affected to one party, that their Conſciences will be forc'd to ſtruggle with the Paſſions either of Love, Hatred, deſire of Revenge, any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Affection of the Mind, or elſe ſome ſtrict Friendſhip or Dependence; all or any of which every man is not endued with Conſtancy enough to ſurmount. Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies alſo are frequently made an end
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59922:128"/>
of by the <hi>Interpoſition</hi> of the common <hi>Friends</hi> of each party, which to do is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly accounted among the beſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a good man. For the reſt, in this <hi>State,</hi> when Performances are not made good by either ſide of their own accord, the other ſeeks his Due after what manner he likes beſt.</p>
                  <p>NOW though it was the Will of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">XI. <hi>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59922:128"/>
incite to make inſults upon other men; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though of a meek and modeſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are forc'd to uſe Violence either in defending themſelves from imminent Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, or by way of Prevention. Beſide that a Rivalſhip in the deſire of the ſame thing in ſome and in others Competition for Priority in one Quality or other ſhall ſet them at Variance. So that in this State 'tis hardly poſſible but that there ſhould be perpetual Jealouſies, Miſtruſts, Deſigns of undoing each other, Eagerneſs to prevent every one his Fellow, or Hopes of making addition to his own Strength by the Ruin of others. Therefore as it is the Duty of every <hi>honeſt</hi> man to be content with his own, and not to give provocation to his Neighbor, nor to covet that which is his; ſo alſo it behoves him who would be as <hi>wary</hi> as is needful, and who is willing to take care of his own good, ſo to take all men for his Friends, as not to ſuppoſe yet but that the ſame may quickly become his Enemies; ſo to cultivate Peace with all men, as to be provided though it be never ſo ſoon chang'd to Enmity. And for this reaſon happy is that Common-wealth where in times of Quietneſs conſideration is had of requiſites for War.</p>

                     </note> we have call'd <hi>Adventitious,</hi> or in which a man is plac'd by ſome antecedent humane Act, <hi>Matrimony</hi> obtains the firſt place. Which alſo is the chief Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Social Life, and the Seed-Plot of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>AND firſt it is certain, that that ardent <note place="margin">II. <hi>Inſtituted by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </note> Propenſity found to be in both Sexes to each other was not implanted in them by the All-wiſe Creator merely that they might receive the Satisfaction of a vain Pleaſure; for had it been ſo, nothing could have been the occaſion of greater Brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Confuſion in the world; but that hereby married perſons might take the greater delight in each others Company; and that both might with the more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs apply themſelves to the neceſſary buſineſs of Propagation, and go through thoſe Cares and Troubles which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Breeding and Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Hence it follows, that all Uſe of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59922:129"/>
the Parts deſtin'd by Nature for this work is contrary to the Law Natural, if it tends not to this End. On which account alſo are forbidden all Luſts for a different <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> or for the ſame Sex; all filthy Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and indeed all Copulations out of the State of Matrimony, whether with the mutual Conſent of both parties, or againſt the Will of the Woman.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Obligation</hi> under which we lie to <note place="margin">III. <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</hi>
                     </note> contract <hi>Matrimony</hi> may be conſider'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with reſpect to <hi>Mankind</hi> in general, or to our particular <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> in the World. The ſtrength of the former of theſe conſiſts in this, that the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind neither can nor ought to be kept up by promiſcuous and uncertain Copulations, but is to be limited and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by the Laws of <hi>Wedlock,</hi> and only to be endeavour'd in a married State: For without this no man can imagine any Decency or orderly Society among men, nor any Obſervation of the Civil Rules of Life. But men <hi>ſingly</hi> conſider'd, are oblig'd to enter the Matrimonial State, when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient occaſion offers itſelf; whereto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not only a mature Age and an Ability for Generation-Work is neceſſary, but there ought beſide to be a poſſibility of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59922:130"/>
on a perſon of the like Condition, and a Capacity of maintaining a Wife and the Poſterity ſhe ſhall bring forth; and that the Man may be ſuch a one as is fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Maſter of a Family. Not ſtill but that any man is excepted from this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who be takes himſelf to a chaſt ſingle life, finding his Conſtitution accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto, and that he is capable in that rather than in the married State, to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Mankind or to the Common-wealth; eſpecially alſo if the Caſe be ſo, that there is no fear of the want of People.</p>
                  <p>BETWEEN thoſe who are about to <note place="margin">IV. <hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi>
                     </note> take upon themſelves the Married State, a <hi>Contract</hi> ought and is wont to intervene, which, if it be <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> conſiſts of theſe heads. Firſt, becauſe the Man (to whom it is moſt agreeable to the Nature of both Sexes that the Contract ſhould owe its Original) intends hereby to get to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Children of his own, not ſpurious or ſuppoſititious; therefore the Woman ought to <hi>plight her troth</hi> to the Man, that ſhe will permit the uſe of her Body to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man but to him; the ſame on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand being required of the Husband. And ſecondly, ſince nothing can be more flatly contrary to a Social and Civil Life,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59922:130"/>
than a vagabond, deſultory and changeable way of Living without any Home, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Seat of his Fortunes; and ſince the Education of that which is the Off-ſpring of both, is moſt conveniently taken care of by the joint help of both Parents toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and whereas continual Cohabitation brings more of Pleaſure and Comfort to a Couple who are well match'd, whereby alſo the Husband may have the greater Aſſurance of his Wives Chaſtity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wife does moreover engage her Faith to her Husband, that ſhe will <hi>always cohabit</hi> with him and join herſelf in the ſtricteſt bond of Society, and become of the ſame Family with him. And this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Promiſe muſt be ſuppoſed to be made from the Husband to her of the like Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, the Nature of this State ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But becauſe it is not only agreeable to the natural Condition of both Sexes, that the Caſe of the Husband ſhould be the more honourable of the two, but that he ſhould alſo be the Head of the Family, of which himſelf is the Author; it follows, that the Wife ought to be ſubject to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in matters relating to their mutual State and to their Houſhold. Hence it is the Prerogative of the Husband to chuſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59922:131"/>
his Habitation, and ſhe may not againſt his Will wander abroad or lodge apart. Yet it does not ſeem eſſentially neceſſary to Matrimony, that the Man ſhould have power of Life and Death or of inflicting any grievous Puniſhment, as neither of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing at his pleaſure of all the Eſtate or Goods of his Wife: but theſe points may be ſettled between the Married Couple by peculiar Agreements, or by the municipal Laws of the Place.</p>
                  <p>NOW though 'tis manifeſtly repugnant <note place="margin">V. <hi>One Man and one Woman.</hi>
                     </note> to the Law of Nature, that one Woman ſhould have more Men than one at once; yet it obtain'd among the <hi>Jews</hi> of old and many other Nations, that one Man might have two or more Wives. Nevertheleſs let us allow never ſo little weight to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought from the Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Marriage deliver'd in Holy Writ, yet it will appear from Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that 'tis much more decent and fit for one Man to be content with one Woman. Which has been approv'd by the Practice of all the Chriſtians through the World that we know of, for ſo many Ages.</p>
                  <p>NOR does the Nature of this ſtrict <note place="margin">VI. <hi>Contract perpetual.</hi>
                     </note> Union tell us leſs plainly, that the Bond of <hi>Matrimony ought to be perpetual,</hi> and not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59922:131"/>
to be unlooſed, but by the Death of one Party; except the <hi>eſſential Articles</hi> of the principal Matrimonial Covenant be viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either by <hi>Adultery</hi> or a wicked and diſhoneſt <hi>Deſertion.</hi> But for <hi>ill diſpoſitions</hi> which have not the ſame Effect with ſuch <hi>lewd Deſertion,</hi> it has obtain'd among Chriſtians that a Separation from Bed and Bord ſhall be ſufficient, without allowing any Engagement in a new Wedlock. And one great Reaſon hereof, among others is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that too free a Liberty of Divorce might not give encouragement to either party to cheriſh a ſtubborn Temper; but rather, that the irremediable State of each might perſuade both to accommodate their Humours to one another and to ſtir them both up to mutual Forbearance. For the reſt, if any Eſſential Article of the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Contract be violated, the <hi>wrong'd Party</hi> only is diſcharg'd from the Oligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the ſame ſtill binding the other, ſo long as the former ſhall think good.</p>
                  <p>ANY man may contract with any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">VII. <hi>Moral Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </note> where the Law makes no ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, if their Age and Conſtitution of Body render them capable of Matrimony, except ſome <hi>Moral Impediment</hi> be in the way: preſuppoſing that he or ſhe is under
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59922:132"/>
a Moral Impediment, who are already mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſome other perſon.</p>
                  <p>AND it is accounted a Moral Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Kinred.</hi>
                     </note> of lawful Matrimony, if the parties are <hi>too nearly allied by Blood or by Affinity.</hi> On which ſcore even by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thoſe Marriages are accounted ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous and wicked which are contracted between any perſons related in the <hi>Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Deſcending</hi> Line. And for thoſe in the other <hi>tranſverſe Order,</hi> as with the Aunt either on the Fathers or Mothers ſide, the Siſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo thoſe in <hi>Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as, with the Mother-in-Law, Step-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Step-Daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Divine Law, but that of moſt civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd Nations, with whom alſo all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans agree, does abominate. Nay the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws of many Countries forbid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage even in the more remote Degrees, that ſo they may keep men from breaking in upon thoſe which are more ſacred, by ſetting the Barrier at a greater diſtance.</p>
                  <p>NOW as the Laws are wont to aſſign <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Ceremony.</hi>
                     </note> to other Contracts and Bargains ſome <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,</hi> which being wanting, the Act ſhall not be adjudg'd of validity: ſo alſo it is in Matrimony, where the Laws require for the ſake of Decency and good Order
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59922:132"/>
that ſuch or ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> be perform'd. And theſe though not enjoin'd by the Law Natural, yet without the ſame thoſe who are Subjects of ſuch a Community, ſhall not conſummate a legal Matrimony; or at leaſt ſuch Contract ſhall not be allow'd by the Publick to be effectual.</p>
                  <p>IT is the Duty of a <hi>Husband</hi> to love <note place="margin">X. <hi>Mutual Duties.</hi>
                     </note> his Wife, to cheriſh, direct and protect her; and of the <hi>Wife</hi> to love and honour her Husband, to be aſſiſtant to him not only in begetting and educating his Children, but to bear her part in the Domeſtick Cares. On both ſides the Nature of ſo ſtrict an Union requires, that the Married Couple be partakers as well in the good as ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of either, and that one ſuccour the other in all Caſes of Diſtreſs; moreover, that they prudently accommodate their Humours to each other; in which matter it is the Wives Duty to ſubmit.</p>

                     </note> Children hath its chief Foundation on a <hi>twofold Cauſe.</hi> Firſt, becauſe the Law of Nature itſelf, when Man was made a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Creature, enjoin'd to <hi>Parents the Care of their Children;</hi> and leſt they ſhould herein be negligent, Nature implanted in them a moſt tender Affection for their Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. Now that this Care may be rightly manag'd, it is requiſite that they have a Power of ordering the Actions of their Children for their good, becauſe theſe as yet underſtand not for want of Diſcretion how to govern themſelves. Next, this Authority is alſo grounded on the <hi>tacit Conſent of their Off-ſpring.</hi> For it may
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59922:133"/>
fairly be preſum'd, that if an Infant at the time of its Birth had the uſe of Reaſon, and ſaw that its Life could not be preſerv'd without the Care of the Parents, to which muſt be join'd a Power over itſelf, it would readily conſent to the ſame, and deſire for itſelf a comfortable Education from them. And this Power as <hi>actually</hi> in the Parents, then when they breed and nurſe up the Child, and from him as well as they can, that he may become a fit Member of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society.</p>
                  <p>BUT whereas the Mother concurs no <note place="margin">III. <hi>Which Parent has great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Right.</hi>
                     </note> leſs than the Father to the Generation of Children, and ſo the Off-ſpring is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both, it may be enquir'd, <hi>which hath the greateſt Right thereto.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which point we are to diſtinguiſh. For if the Iſſue were begotten <hi>not in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,</hi> the ſame ſhall be rather the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe here the Father cannot be known except the Mother diſcover him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe alſo who live in a State of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty</hi> and above Laws, it may be agreed that the Mothers claim ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to that of the Father.

as is neceſſary for this End: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by no means extends itſelf ſo as to give the Parents liberty to deſtroy their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Off-ſpring, or to caſt away or kill it when it is born. For tho 'tis true, the Iſſue is of the Subſtance of the Parents, yet it is placed in a Human State equal to themſelves, and capable of receiving Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from them. Neither alſo does this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority veſt them with the Exerciſe of a Power of Life and Death, upon occaſion of any Fault, but only allows them to give moderate Chaſtiſement: ſince the Age we ſpeak of is too tender to admit of ſuch hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crimes as are to be puniſh'd with Death. But if a Child ſhall ſtubbornly ſpurn at all Inſtruction, and become hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Amendment, the Father may turn him out of his own Houſe, and abdicate or renounce him.</p>

There at firſt probably offer'd themſelves, driven thereto by Neceſſity or a Conſciouſneſs of their own want of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and then being aſſur'd that they ſhould conſtantly be ſupplied with Food and Neceſſaries, they devoted all their Services for ever to their Maſter. And then Wars raging up and down the World, it grew a Cuſtom with moſt Nations, that thoſe <hi>Captives</hi> to whom they granted their Lives ſhould be made Slaves ever after, together with the Poſterity born of them. Though in many Countries no ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude is in uſe; but all Domeſtic Offices
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59922:138"/>
are perform'd by Mercenary Servants hired for a certain time.</p>
                  <p>NOW as there are ſeveral <hi>Degrees,</hi> as <note place="margin">II. <hi>A tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
                     </note> it were, of <hi>Servitude,</hi> ſo the Power of the Maſters and the Condition of the Servants do vary. To a <hi>Servant hired</hi> for a time the Duty of the Maſter is to pay him his <hi>Wages;</hi> the other making good on his part the <hi>Work</hi> as agreed for: And becauſe in this Contract the Condition of the Maſter is the better, therefore ſuch Servant is alſo to pay Reſpect to his Maſter according to his Dignity; and if he have done his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs knaviſhly or negligently, he is liable to Puniſhment from him; provided it go not ſo far as any grievous Maiming of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, much leſs ſo far as Infliction of Death.</p>
                  <p>BUT to ſuch a Servant as <hi>voluntarily</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. <hi>A volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Servant.</hi>

In thus doing how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Maſter is to have a regard to the Strength and Dexterity of his Servant, not exacting rigorouſly of him what is above
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59922:138"/>
his power to do. Now this ſort of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is not only ſubject to the Chaſtiſement of his Maſter for his Negligence, but the ſame may correct his Manners which ought to be accommodated to preſerve Order and Decency in the Family: But he may not fell him againſt his Will; becauſe he <hi>choſe this</hi> for his Maſter of his own accord, and not another; and it concerns him much with whom he ſerves. If he have been guilty of any heinous Crime againſt one not of the ſame Family, he is ſubject to the Civil Power, if he live in a Community; but if the Family be independent, he may be expell'd. But if the Crime be againſt the ſame Family, it being independent, the Head thereof may inflict even Capital Puniſhment.</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Slaves</hi> are frequently treated with greater Severity, ſomething of a hoſtile Rage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining towards 'em, and for that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the worſt upon us and our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.

never been born, if the Maſter had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Rigor of War upon the Parent; and for that the Parent having nothing ſhe can call her own, the Off ſpring cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be brought up but at her Maſters charge.

But 'tis manifeſt, that ſince theſe Bondmen came into a State of Servitude not by any fault of their own, there can be no Pretence they ſhould be otherwiſe dealt withal, than as if they were in the condition of perpetual hired Servants.</p>

                     </note> Reaſon which induc'd Maſters of Families to quit their own natural Liberty, and to form themſelves into Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was; that they might provide for themſelves a Security and Defence againſt the evils and miſchiefs that are incident to Men from one another. For as, next under God, one Man is moſt capable of being helpful to another; ſo the ſame may be no leſs prejudicial and hurtful to one another. And thoſe perſons have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a right conception of the Malice of Men, and the remedy thereof, who have
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59922:142"/>
admitted this as a common Maxim and Proverb; that unleſs there were Courts of Judicature, one Man would devour another. But after that by the Conſtituting of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, Men were reduc'd into ſuch an Order and Method, that they might be ſafe and ſecure from mutual Wrongs and Injuries among themſelves, it was by that means provided, that thereby they might the better enjoy thoſe Advantages, which are to be reap'd and expected from one another, to wit, that they might from their Childhood be brought up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in good Manners, and that they might invent and improve ſeveral kinds of Arts and Sciences whereby the Life of Man might be better provided and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with neceſſary Conveniences.</p>
                  <p>AND the Reaſon will be yet more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>Farther Penalties.</hi>
                     </note> for the Conſtituting of Communities, if we conſider, that other means would not have been capable of curbing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Men. For although we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by the Law of Nature not to do any injury one to another; yet the reſpect and reverence to that Law is not of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence as to be a ſufficient ſecurity for Men to live altogether quietly and undiſturb'd
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59922:142"/>
in their Natural Liberty. For although, by accident, there may be found ſome few Men of that moderate quiet temper and diſpoſition, that they would do no injury to others, though they might eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd; and there may be likewiſe ſome others that in ſome meaſure bridle in their diſorderly Affections through fear of ſome miſchief that may enſue from thence; yet on the contrary there are a great number of ſuch, as have no regard at all to Law or Juſtice, whenever they have any proſpect of Advantage, or any hopes, by their own ſubtile Tricks and Contrivances of being too hard for, and deluding the injur'd Party. And as it behoves every one, that would take care of his own ſafety, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure himſelf againſt this ſort of Perſons; ſo no better care and proviſion can be made than by means of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Civil Societies. For altho ſome particular perſons may mutually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together to aſſiſt each other; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be ſome way found out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Opinions and Judgments may be united together, and their Wills may be more firmly bound to the performance of what they have agreed upon, it will be in vain for any one to expect and rely upon
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59922:143"/>
any certain Succour and Aſſiſtance from them.</p>

For ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Perſons, through the prejudice of Cuſtom and Education, are as it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deaf to the force and power of Reaſon. Whence it comes to paſs, that they are only intent upon ſuch things as are preſent, taking very little notice of thoſe things which are future; and that they are affected only with thoſe things which make a preſent impreſſion upon their Senſes. But ſince the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is wont to proceed on but ſlowly; from whence many ill Men have taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to refer their evils and misfortunes to other Cauſes; eſpecially ſince they very often ſee wicked Men enjoy a plenty and abundance of thoſe things wherein the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort eſteem their Happineſs and Felicity to conſiſt.

And therefore the moſt preſent and effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, for the quelling and ſuppreſſing the evil Deſires and Inclinations of Men, is to be provided by the Conſtituting of Civil Societies.</p>

Inclinations and Judgments in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is moſt conducive to ſuch an End: to which in many there is join'd a <hi>Dulneſs</hi> in diſcerning that Reſolution, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſeveral, which may be moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, and a certain <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever Opinion we have once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd.

that they are willing to be made Fellow-Members of the ſame Society. To which Covenant, it is requiſite, that All and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Perſons do conſent and agree, and he that does not give his Conſent, remains ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſuch Society.</p>

                     </note> to have ſubmitted their Will to the Will and Pleaſure of the Governours, in ſuch Affairs as concern the Safety of the Publick, being willing to do whatſoever they require. That this may be effected, it is neceſſary, that the Governours do <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi> to thoſe who are to be govern'd, what their Will and Pleaſure is concerning ſuch Matters. And this they do not only by their <hi>Commands</hi> directed to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons about particular Affairs; but alſo by certain general <hi>Rules,</hi> whence all Perſons may at all times have a clear and diſtinct Knowledg of what they are to do or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. By which likewiſe it is commonly defin'd and determin'd what ought to be look'd upon to be each Man's Right and Propriety, and what does properly belong
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59922:149"/>
to Another, what is to be eſteem'd Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and what Unlawful in any Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, what Commendable or what Baſe; what every man may do by his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty, or how every one may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and order his own particular Rights towards the advancement of the common Peace and Tranquillity; In fine, what and after what manner every one by Right may lay claim to from another. For it conduces very much to the Peace and Proſperity of any Civil Society, that all theſe things ſhould be clearly and plainly laid down and determin'd.</p>

Now that this End may the better be obtain'd by thoſe Men, with whom we are link'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame Society; it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that they ſhould mutually agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves not to injure one Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor is it enough that the bare Will and Pleaſure of the Supreme Magiſtrate ſhould be made known to them; but 'tis likewiſe requiſite that there ſhould be a

certain Fear and Dread of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and a Power and Ability of inflicting the ſame. Which <hi>Puniſhment</hi> or <hi>Penalty,</hi> that it may be ſufficient for this End, is to be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd; that there may plainly appear a greater Damage in violating the Laws than in obſerving them; and that ſo the <hi>Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi> of the Penalty may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Advantage,</hi> gotten or expected by doing the Injury.

                     </note> Government: The Firſt is, when the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority is in <hi>one Man;</hi> and that is call'd a <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The ſecond, when the ſame is lodg'd in a ſelect <hi>Number</hi> of Men, and that is an <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi> The Third, when it is in a Council or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Free-holders and Principal Citizens, and that is a <hi>Democracy.</hi> In the Firſt, he who bears the Supreme Rule, is ſtil'd a <hi>Monarch,</hi> in the Second the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and in the Third the <hi>People.</hi>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59922:152"/>
neceſſary Actions of Government. But that the Nobles and the People, who are not as one Natural Perſon, may be able ſo to do, it is neceſſary that they meet at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Time and Place; there to debate and reſolve upon all Publick Buſineſs.

Although it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that many by theſe Nick-names do not ſo much expreſs the Diſtemper of ſuch a Government, as their own Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion for the preſent Governours and Conſtitution.

                     <hi>Subject</hi> is a thing to be required in Conſtituting of every lawful Government, yet it is not always obtain'd the ſame way. For as it is ſometimes ſeen, that a Prince aſcends the Throne with the <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Acclamations of the People;</hi> ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he makes himſelf a King by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi> and brings a People to conſent by <hi>Military force.</hi>

WHICH latter Method of acquiring <note place="margin">II. <hi>Of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</hi>
                     </note> a Government is called <hi>Conqueſt:</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, as often as a Victorious Prince, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fortune on his ſide and a juſt Cauſe, reduces a People by his Arms to ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, as compel them to receive him for their Governour. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Title is derived, not only from the Conquerours Clemency in ſaving the Lives of all thoſe whom in ſtrictneſs of War he was at liberty to deſtroy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof laying only a leſſer inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience upon them; but likewiſe from hence, that when a Prince will chooſe to go to War with one that he has injured, rather than he will condeſcend to ſatisfie him in a juſt and equal manner; He is to be preſum'd to caſt himſelf upon the fortune of War with this intention, that he does beforehand <hi>tacitly</hi> conſent to accept of any Conditions whatſoever ſhall befal him in the Event.</p>

                     <hi>People,</hi> a Government is acquired by it, when in an <hi>Election</hi> the People either in order to their Settlement, or at any time after, do nominate ſuch a One to bear that Office as they believe is capable of it. Who, upon preſentation of their Pleaſure to

                     </note> Prince and the Death of the former, there uſes in Monarchies that are already fix'd and ſettled to intercede an <hi>Interregnum;</hi> which ſignifies an imperfect kind of State, where the People keep together merely by Virtue of their <hi>Original Compact:</hi> Only that this is much ſtrengthned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Name and love of their Country, and the ſettlement of moſt of their Fortunes there; whereby all good Men are obliged to preſerve the Peace with one another, and ſtudy to reſtore their fallen Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again as ſoon as they can. Yet to prevent the miſchiefs which are apt to ariſe in <hi>Interregnums,</hi> it is very convenient the Law ſhould provide <hi>Adminiſtrators,</hi> to manage the publick Affairs during the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>NOW tho, as is ſaid, in ſome Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies; <note place="margin">V. <hi>Succeſſion.</hi>

                     </note> from the very Beginning was founded upon the voluntary Choice of the People, there the <hi>Order of Succeſſion muſt have an Original Dependence upon the Will of the ſame People.</hi> For if, together with the Crown, they did confer upon the Prince the Right of appointing his Succeſſour; whoſoever ſhall be nominated to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion by him, will have all the Right to enjoy it. If they did not confer it upon the Prince, it is to be underſtood as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to themſelves.

out any thing farther expreſs'd; Though 'tis true it may ſeem to be intended, that the Crown ſhall paſs to the Heirs in the ſame common order of Deſcent as private Inheritances do; Yet the publick Good requires, that the ſenſe of ſuch a Publick Act ſhall be taken under ſome <hi>reſtrictions,</hi> notwithſtanding their not being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſs'd. As 1. It is ſuppoſed, <hi>That</hi> the Kingdom ſhall continue inſeparable, as one Realm. 2. <hi>That</hi> the Succeſſion ſhall go to the Deſcendants of the firſt Prince of the Line. Excluding 3.

                  <p>IT will conduce to the advancement of <note place="margin">V. <hi>The Laws, plain and few.</hi>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59922:162"/>
than their underſtanding in the Laws; whenever the Laws do ſo abound in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as not eaſily to be retain'd in Memory, and are ſo particular in their Matter, as to prohibit things which are unprohibited by the light of Reaſon, it muſt certainly come to paſs, that innocent Perſons, who have not had the leaſt ill intention to tranſgreſs the Laws, will be many times unknowingly hamper'd by them, as by Snares, to their unreaſonable prejudice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very end of Societies and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

They are not to extend their Pardons to any without ſufficient reaſon. For it is an unjuſt practice, which tends greatly to irritate the minds of people againſt the Government, not to uſe Equality (all Circumſtances conſidered) towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59922:162"/>
that are Equal in their deſervings.</p>

                     </note> under a <hi>Penalty,</hi> without the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome <hi>profit</hi> to the Common-wealth; So in the <hi>fixing of Penalties proportionably to that end,</hi> it is fitting to obſerve a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; with care, that the damage thence ariſing to the Subject on the one hand, exceed not the advantage that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Common-wealth on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     </note> of people in incorporating together in a Common-wealth, is their ſecurity from harms and Violence; it is the Duty of the Supreme Magiſtrate to <hi>prohibit any injury of one Subject to another</hi> ſo much the more ſeverely, becauſe by their conſtant Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in the ſame place they have the fairer opportunities to do them or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59922:163"/>
the leſs at their pleaſure. Neither has any Subject whatſoever the liberty to ſeek his ſatisfaction for the Injuries, he preſumes are done him, in the way of a private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. For the deſign of Government is deſtroy'd by ſuch a Proceeding as this.</p>
                  <p>AND although there is no one Prince, <note place="margin">IX. <hi>Miniſters of State and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>
                     </note> how ingenious ſoever in Buſineſs, that is able in his own perſon to manage all the Affairs of a Nation of any conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but he muſt have <hi>Miniſters to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate with him in his Cares and Counſels;</hi> Yet as theſe Miniſters borrow their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in every thing they do, from Him; So the praiſe or diſpraiſe of their Actions returns finally upon Him alſo. For which reaſon, and becauſe according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Miniſters, buſineſs is done either well or ill, there lies an Obligation upon a Prince to advance honeſt and fit Perſons to Offices of Truſt in the Government, and upon occaſion to examine into the proceedings of the ſame; and as he finds them deſerving, to reward or puniſh them accordingly, for an Example to others to underſtand, that there is no leſs fidelity and diligence to be uſed in managing the publick Buſineſs, than one would practiſe in any private Affair that relates to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59922:163"/>
So when wicked people are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to put their Inclinations in practice upon the hopes of eſcaping very eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd under <hi>Judges that are ſubject to Corruption;</hi> it' is a Prince's Duty to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert ſeverely upon ſuch Judges, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of Vice, againſt the ſafety of the Subject and quiet of the Nation. And though the diſpatching of the <hi>ordinary</hi> affairs may be committed to the Miniſters care; yet a Prince is never to refuſe to lend his Ear with Patience, when his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects preſent him with their Complaints and Addreſſes.</p>

                     </note> which Subjects are upon no other account oblig'd, than as they are neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the publick Charge in Peace and War; it deſerves to be the Care of Princes not to extort more, than either the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities or ſignal advantages of the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and ſo to alleviate and ſoften them in the ways and means of laying them upon the Subject, that every one may find their weight as little offenſive as it can poſſibly be; being charg'd upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in a fair and Equitable proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without favouring of one to deceive or oppreſs another. And let not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59922:164"/>
that is ſo rais'd be conſum'd by Princes in Luxury and Vanities, or thrown away in Gifts and needleſs Oſtentation; but laid out upon the occaſions of the Nation: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways foreſeeing that their Expences be made to anſwer to their Revenue; and in caſe of any failure in the latter to do it, that they attempt a Remedy by means of Frugality and in retrenching unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Expences.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, Princes have no Obligation <note place="margin">XI. <hi>Intereſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by Princes.</hi>
                     </note> upon them to find maintenance for their Subjects, otherwiſe than Charity directs them to a particular Care of thoſe, for whom it is impoſſible to ſubſiſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reaſon of ſome Calamity unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Yet becauſe the Money, that is neceſſary for the conſervation of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, muſt be raiſed out of the Subjects Eſtates, in whoſe Wealth and Happineſs the ſtrength of a Nation does conſiſt; it therefore concerns Princes to uſe their beſt Endeavours, <hi>that the fortunes of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects improve and flouriſh:</hi> as particularly by giving Orders, how the fruits of the Earth and Water may be received in the moſt plentiful meaſure; and that men employ their Induſtry on things of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick growth, not purchaſing at their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59922:164"/>
Expence that Labour from others, which themſelves are able conveniently to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. <hi>That</hi> all Mechanick Arts and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and in Maritime places, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be encourag'd, as of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Common-wealth.

                  <p>IT now remains, that we take a View <note place="margin">I. <hi>What they are.</hi>
                     </note> of the particular parts of Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, together with ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereunto belonging as we find are worthy to be obſerv'd. In the firſt place there are the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> meaning the Acts and Conſtitutions of the higheſt <hi>Civil</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the time being, ordained to direct the Subject in the courſe of his Life as to what things he ought to do, and what to omit.</p>
                  <p>THEY are called <hi>Civil,</hi> upon two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts <note place="margin">II. <hi>Why ſo call'd.</hi>

                  <p>AS nothing therefore ought to be made <note place="margin">III. <hi>The Law of Nature, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced by them.</hi>

For ſince indeed the wickedneſs of a great part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is arrived to a degree, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the apparent Excellency of the Law of Nature nor the fear of God himſelf is ſufficient to reſtrain; the moſt effectual Method remaining, to preſerve the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of living in a Community, is, by the authority of the Government to inforce the <hi>Natural</hi> by the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> and ſupply the Diſability of the one with the Power of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:59922:166"/>
NOW the <hi>Force and Power, which is in</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> conſiſts in this; that to the Aſſertory part of the Statute, concerning Things to be done or omitted, there is annex'd a <hi>Penal Sanction,</hi> rehearſing the Puniſhment that is appointed to attend a man in a Court of Juſtice for omitting what he ought to do, or doing what he ought to omit. Of which kind of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the Laws of Nature being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtitute, the breaking of them does not fall under the puniſhment of any Court in this World; but yet is reſerv'd for the Judgment of the Tribunal of God.</p>
                  <p>MORE particularly it is inconſiſtent <note place="margin">V. <hi>Of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                     </note> with the nature of living in a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for every one, what he accounts to be his due, to exact it of his own proper Violence. So that here the Civil Laws come in to the aſſiſtance of the Natural. For they allow the Creditor the benefit of an <hi>Action,</hi> whereby the Debt that is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him by Virtue of a Law of Nature, with the help of the Magiſtrate, may be demanded and recovered in a Court of Juſtice, according to the Courſe of the Laws of the Kingdom: whereas without ſuch enforcement of the ſaid Laws, you can extort nothing from a Debtor againſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59922:167"/>
his Will; but muſt entirely depend upon his Conſcience and Honour. The Civil Laws admit of <hi>Actions</hi> chiefly in the Caſe of thoſe Obligations, that are contracted betwixt Parties by an expreſs Bond or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. For as to other Affairs, where the Obligation ariſes from ſome indefinite Duty of the Law of Nature, the Civil Laws make them not ſubject to an Action at all; on purpoſe to give occaſion to good men to exerciſe their Virtue, to their more extraordinary Praiſe, when it is evident they do that which is juſt and honeſt without Compulſion. Beſide that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qently the point in queſtion may not be of Conſequence enough to trouble a Court about it.</p>
                  <p>AND whereas the Law of Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <note place="margin">VI. <hi>The proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them.</hi>
                     </note> many things at large, in an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite manner, and leaves the application of them to every one in his own breaſt; the Civil Laws, being careful of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Tranquillity of the Community, preſcribe a <hi>certain time, manner, place, perſons, and other circumſtances,</hi> for the due proſecution of thoſe Actions, with the propoſal of a Reward upon occaſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage people to enter upon them. And when any thing is obſcure in the Law of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59922:167"/>
Nature, the Civil Laws <hi>explain</hi> it. Which Explication the Subjects are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and follow, although their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinions do otherwiſe lead them to a contrary ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>So that there being thus a number of <note place="margin">VII. <hi>Form.</hi>
                     </note> Actions left by the Law of Nature to be conſidered according to the will and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each perſon, which nevertheleſs in a Common-wealth ought to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſtated for the greater Decency and Quiet of the ſame; it uſes to be the care of the Civil Laws to reduce all thoſe Actions, with their reſpective Concerns, to <hi>a proper Form;</hi> as we ſee it is in Wills, Contracts, and divers other Caſes: from whence it comes, that they limit us (as they do) in the exerciſe of ſeveral Rights, to the uſe whereof the Law of Nature left us much at liberty.</p>
                  <p>FOR ſo far as the Civil Laws do not <note place="margin">VIII. <hi>The Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to the Civil Laws.</hi>
                     </note> openly contradict the Law of God, the Subject ſtands <hi>oblig'd to obey them,</hi> not merely out of fear of Puniſhment, but by an internal Obligation confirm'd by the Precepts of the Law of Nature it ſelf. This being one of them, amongſt others, that <hi>Subjects ought to obey their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:59922:168"/>
NAY, it is their Duty to obey even <note place="margin">IX. <hi>And to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>perſonal Commands</hi> of their Sovereigns, no leſs than they do the Common Laws of the Kingdom. Only here they muſt obſerve, whether the thing commanded is to be done by them <hi>as in their own Names,</hi> in the quality of an Action belonging <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to Subjects to do;</hi> or whether it be barely to undertake the <hi>Execution</hi> of an Affair for the Sovereign, in conſequence of that Authority which he has to command it. In the latter Caſe, the Neceſſity that is impoſed upon the Subject excuſes him from Sin, though the Fact it ſelf is a Sin in the Sovereign to command. But in the other, for a Subject as in his own name to do a thing which is repugnant to the Laws of God and Nature, it can never be lawful. And this is the reaſon, why if a Subject takes up Arms in an unjuſt War at the Command of his Sovereign, he ſins not: Yet if he condemns the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or accuſes and witneſſes againſt them falſely upon the like Command, he ſins. For as he ſerves in War, he ſerves in the name of the Publick: but acting as a Judge, Witneſs, or Accuſer, he does it in his Own.</p>

On which occaſions that they may be able to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Skill and Bravery, it is fit they ſhould be exerciſed and prepared for the purpoſe.

                  <p>THE Government claims a Power <note place="margin">III. <hi>Directly.</hi>
                     </note> to take away the Lives of Subjects <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,</hi> upon the occaſion of any heinous Crimes committed by them; whereon it paſſes judgment of Death by way of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> As likewiſe the Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of Criminals are ſubject to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Law. So that here ſome Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things concerning the nature of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments come to be diſcourſed.</p>
                  <p>PUNISHMENT is an Evil that is <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,</hi>

For although the <hi>doing</hi> of ſome things may oftentimes be commanded in the place of a Puniſhment, yet it is upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59922:169"/>
that the things to be done are troubleſome and laborious to the doer, who will therefore find his ſufferings in the performance of ſuch Action. A <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> alſo ſignifies its being inflicted againſt the wills of people: For it would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe obtain its end; which is, to deter them from Crimes by the ſenſe of its Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity: An effect it never will produce, if it were only ſuch, as an Offender is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and pleaſed to undergo. As for other Sufferings, which happen to be undergone in Wars and Engagements; or which one bears innocently, through the means of an Injury done him: the former not being inflicted by Authority, and the other not referring to an antecedent Crime, they do neither of them import the proper ſenſe and meaning of a <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>

For without this, it will be always lawful, what by force is loſt, by force to retrieve again.
